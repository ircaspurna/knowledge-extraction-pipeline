**A complete, production-ready system for extracting structured knowledge from academic PDFs and building professional knowledge graphs.**

## ✨ Features

- 📄 **PDF Processing** - Extract text from PDFs with page-level tracking
- 🧠 **Concept Extraction** - Claude MCP-powered semantic extraction
- 🔗 **Entity Resolution** - Smart deduplication using embeddings
- 📊 **Knowledge Graphs** - NetworkX graphs with Neo4j export
- 🔍 **Semantic Search** - Vector-based document search with ChromaDB
- 🎨 **Visualization** - Interactive Cytoscape.js & Neo4j Browser

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ircaspurna/knowledge-extraction-pipeline.git
cd knowledge-extraction-pipeline

# Install the package (development mode)
pip install -e .

# Or install directly
pip install .
```

### Process Your First PDF

```bash
# Complete pipeline: PDF → Chunks → Concepts → Entities → Graph
python scripts/process_pdf.py paper.pdf --output ./output/

# The script will:
# 1. Extract text and create semantic chunks
# 2. Generate extraction prompts for Claude MCP
# 3. Parse extraction responses (requires manual Claude step)
# 4. Resolve entities and build knowledge graph

# Search across processed documents
python scripts/search.py ./output/chroma_db "cognitive load"

# Build topic graph from multiple papers
python scripts/build_graph.py ./output/ --output topic_graph.json

# Import to Neo4j for advanced visualization (optional)
python scripts/import_neo4j.py ./output/knowledge_graph.json
```

## 📖 Documentation

### Examples

- **[Batch Workflow](examples/batch_workflow/)** - Process multiple PDFs in parallel
- **[Custom Domain](examples/custom_domain/)** - Customize extraction for your domain

### Core Modules

- **Document Processor** (`knowledge_extraction.core.DocumentProcessor`) - PDF text extraction
- **Semantic Chunker** (`knowledge_extraction.core.SemanticChunker`) - Intelligent text chunking
- **Vector Store** (`knowledge_extraction.core.VectorStore`) - ChromaDB-backed vector search
- **Graph Builder** (`knowledge_extraction.core.GraphBuilder`) - NetworkX graph construction
- **Concept Extractor** (`knowledge_extraction.extraction.ConceptExtractorMCP`) - MCP-based concept extraction
- **Entity Resolver** (`knowledge_extraction.extraction.EntityResolverMCP`) - Entity deduplication
- **Relationship Extractor** (`knowledge_extraction.extraction.RelationshipExtractor`) - Relationship classification

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
Input PDF
    ↓
[Document Processor] → Extract text, preserve structure
    ↓
[Semantic Chunker] → Create semantic chunks
    ↓
[Vector Store] → Index with ChromaDB
    ↓
[Concept Extractor] → Extract concepts (Claude MCP)
    ↓
[Entity Resolver] → Deduplicate with embeddings
    ↓
[Graph Builder] → Build NetworkX graph
    ↓
[Visualization] → Neo4j / Cytoscape.js
```

## 🎯 Use Cases

- **Literature Reviews** - Extract concepts from 100+ papers automatically
- **Research Synthesis** - Build unified knowledge graphs across disciplines
- **Knowledge Management** - Organize internal research documents
- **Systematic Reviews** - Structure extraction for meta-analysis

## 📊 Performance

- Processes **300-page book in ~15 minutes**
- Extracts **500-1,000 concepts per book**
- **40-60% cost savings** vs direct API calls (using MCP)
- Handles **10,000+ entity graphs** in Neo4j

## 💡 Key Innovation: MCP Integration

This pipeline uses **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** for concept extraction, providing:
- **Lower costs** compared to direct API calls
- **Better quality** through structured prompts
- **Full control** over extraction workflow
- **Offline processing** capability
