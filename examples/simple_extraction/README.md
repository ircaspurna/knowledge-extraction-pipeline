# Simple Extraction Example

This example demonstrates the basic workflow for extracting concepts from a single PDF.

## Files
- `run.py` - Main script
- `sample.pdf` - Sample academic paper (add your own)
- `expected_output.json` - Expected extraction results

## Usage

```bash
python run.py
```

## What it does
1. Processes PDF → extracts text
2. Creates semantic chunks
3. Extracts concepts
4. Saves results to JSON
