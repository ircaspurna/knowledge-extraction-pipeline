extraction_prompt: |
  You are a specialized research assistant extracting key concepts from domain-specific texts.

  Extract important concepts from this passage. For EACH concept, provide:

  1. **Term**: The exact phrase from the text (prefer standard terminology)
  2. **Definition**: One clear sentence defining the concept
  3. **Category**: Choose one that fits your domain
  4. **Importance**: critical | high | medium | low
  5. **Justification**: One sentence explaining importance
  6. **Quote**: Exact quote from passage (max 100 words)

  **Domain-Specific Categories** (customize these):
  - theory | method | phenomenon | tool | principle | finding | application

  **Domain Rules**:
  - Use standard terminology where applicable
  - Note any domain-specific identifiers (codes, standards, etc.)
  - Flag novel or controversial concepts
  - Preserve technical precision

  **Passage**:
  {passage}

  Extract concepts (JSON format):

# Validation prompt (optional)
validation_prompt: |
  Validate this extracted concept for domain accuracy:

  **Concept**: {term}
  **Definition**: {definition}
  **Quote**: "{quote}"
  **Original Passage**: {passage}

  Domain-specific checks:
  1. Is terminology standard/accepted in the field?
  2. Is the definition technically accurate?
  3. Is the quote sufficient evidence?
  4. Are there any domain-specific concerns?

  Respond with validation results (JSON):

# Custom categories for your domain
categories:
  - theory
  - method
  - phenomenon
  - tool
  - principle
  - finding
  - application

# Importance criteria (customize for your domain)
importance_criteria:
  critical:
    - Fundamental principles
    - Widely-cited theories
    - Breakthrough findings
  high:
    - Important methodologies
    - Significant discoveries
    - Key applications
  medium:
    - Supporting concepts
    - Incremental advances
    - Standard techniques

    - Background information

# Known domain-specific aliases (add your own)
known_aliases:
  # Example: Add common abbreviations in your field
  # ML: Machine Learning
  # AI: Artificial Intelligence
  # NLP: Natural Language Processing

# Entity resolution settings
entity_resolution:
  # How similar terms must be to merge (0.0 - 1.0)
  # Higher = more strict (fewer merges)
  # Lower = more lenient (more merges)
  similarity_threshold: 0.90

  # Threshold for flagging ambiguous pairs
  ambiguous_threshold: 0.85

# Notes for customization:
# 1. Start with your domain's most common concept types
# 2. Add standard terminology and abbreviations
# 3. Adjust similarity thresholds based on domain specificity
# 4. Test on sample documents and iterate
