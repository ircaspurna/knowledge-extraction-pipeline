How often does\nembeddedness occur, who communicates embedded deceptions and truths, and\nwhat linguistic characteristics reveal embeddedness? In this study, nearly 800 partici-\npants deceived or told the truth about their friends and indicated the embedded\ndeceptions (e.g., false statements told within entirely false or truthful messages) and\ntruths (e.g., truthful statements told within entirely false or truthful messages).\nEmbedded deceiving and truth-telling rates were only statistically different among\nthose who were instructed to tell the truth. Therefore, the distribution of embedded\ndeceptions and truths were similar for false statements, but dissimilar for truthful\nstatements. Embedded truths were also more likely to be written by women\n(vs men), liberals (vs conservatives), and communicated in a formal versus narrative\nstyle. Theoretical implications are discussed.\nKEYWORDS\nautomated text analysis, deception, embedded deception, embeddedness, language, lying\n1 | DECONSTRUCTING DECEPTION\n1.1 | Frequency, communicator characteristics,\nand linguistic features of embeddedness\nBefore giving sworn testimony, an oath officer typically asks a witness\nthe following question: \u201cDo you swear to tell the truth, the whole\ntruth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?\u201d This famed state-\nment in the US judicial system holds witnesses to account by suggest-\ning that any deceptive information communicated during their\ntestimony can result in a charge of perjury. A critical issue exists with\nthe question at hand, however, because it assumes that one's state-\nment will be wholly and unequivocally truthful when communicated.\nThis assumption fails to reflect reality (e.g., lies are not completely\nfalse, truths are not completely truthful), which undermines our ability\nto describe the actual composition of lies and truths.\nPrior work has addressed the idea of embeddedness (e.g., how\nfalsehoods are embedded within truths, how truths are embedded in\nfalsehoods) in several empirical studies and from different theoretical\nperspectives (Amado et al.,\n2016; Caso et al., 2023; Gnisci\net al., 2010; Leins et al., 2013; Levine, 2020; Luke, 2019;\nMarkowitz, 2020; McCornack et al., 2014; Nahari, 2018; Nahari &\nVrij, 2015; Sporer & Walther,2006; Str\u00f6mwall & Will\u00e9n,2011; Verigin\net al., 2019, 2020; Vrij, 2008; Vrij et al., 2007; Vrij, Granhag, &\nPorter, 2010; Vrij & Mann,2001; Vrij, Mann, et al.,2010; Walczyk\net al., 2014). Specifically, embeddedness describes verbal behavior\nwhere communicators, instead of telling a wholly truthful or untruth-\nful story, will\u201cchange specific vital details\u201d in an otherwise truthful or\nuntruthful story (Vrij, Granhag, & Porter,2010, p. 94) Despite prior\nwork that has predominantly evaluated how embeddedness can be\nrevealed by details in a statement, outstanding and fundamental ques-\ntions remain. Principally, what is the elemental composition of\nReceived: 18 January 2024 Revised: 10 April 2024 Accepted: 20 May 2024\nDOI: 10.1002/acp.4215\nThis is an open access article under the terms of theCreative Commons AttributionLicense, which permits use, distribution and reproduction in any medium,\nprovided the original work is properly cited.\n\u00a9 2024 The Author(s).Applied Cognitive Psychologypublished by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.\nAppl Cognit Psychol.2024;38:e4215. wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/acp 1o f1 6\nhttps://doi.org/10.1002/acp.4215\n\n\ndeceptions and truths? The concept of embeddedness is advanced in\nthis paper by understanding the distribution of deceptions and truths\nin false and truthful communication patterns, the antecedents of\nembeddedness (e.g., who communicates embedded deceptions and\ntruths the most), and its defining linguistic characteristics (e.g., the\nverbal features of embedded deceptions and truths). The next\nsection describes how the concept of embeddedness is rooted in\ndeception theory and how it has been examined empirically.\n1.2 | Embedded deceptions: Support from\ndeception theory\nThe idea that deceptive and truthful messages are not completely\ndeceptive nor completely truthful is supported by Information Manip-\nulation Theory (McCornack,\n1992). The theory presupposes that much\nof deception research has rested on a bald-faced lie and bald-faced\ntruth dichotomy, which is inconsistent with how people actually tell\nlies and truths (Bond & DePaulo,\n2006; McCornack, 1997; Sporer &\nSchwandt, 2007; Verigin et al.,2020). Instead, McCornack and col-\nleagues argue that when people interact, they often abide by several\nconversational rules that are inherently cooperative in nature\n(Grice,\n1989). These rules, called Grice's Maxims, are of great interest\nto deception scholars when cooperationdoes not occur(Grice, 1975,\n1989). That is, such covert violations of Gricean maxims of quantity\n(e.g., the amount of information), quality (e.g., the truthfulness of the\ninformation), manner (e.g., how the information is communicated), and\nrelation (e.g., the relevance of the information) constitute information\nmanipulation in various forms (Markowitz,\n2020; McCornack, 1992;\nMcCornack et al., 2014). For example, as others indicate\n(Levine, 2001), lying by omission violates the maxim of quantity, and\nlying by equivocation violates the maxim of manner.\nThe issue with considering lies and truths as completely false or\ncompletely truthful is that\u201cby placing messages into global categories\n(rather than construing them as existing at the intersection of multiple\ndimensions) we necessarily lose information relevant to the subtle\nmessage features that potentially influence deceptiveness \u201d\n(McCornack,\n1992, p. 11). Like a faucet that can run both warm and\ncold water simultaneously (Markowitz, 2020), communication pat-\nterns can contain both deceptive and truthful elements within the\nsame statement and draw on a common pool of communication data.\nIt is therefore critical to investigate if false statements indeed contain\na greater amount of false communication data than truthful communi-\ncation data, and if truthful statements indeed contain a greater\namount of truthful communication data than false communication\ndata. Importantly, a goal of this piece is not to provide a definitive rate\nor percentage of how much false and truthful information will be\nwithin false and truthful messages across all communication acts,\nprompts, or contexts. Instead, this piece aims to be a first step in test-\ning the validity of a more basic assumption about embeddedness in\ndeceptive communication: that false messages are more false than\ntruthful, and truthful messages are more truthful than false. This\nassumption is examined empirically in the current study, along with an\nexploratory examination of the social and psychological correlates of\nembeddedness. A careful reader will also notice that prior work has\nused the term embedded lies to describe false statements that are\nembedded within entirely false or truthful messages. Here, the term\nembedded deceptions is used, instead. This was purposeful, based on\ndefinitions offered by Levine (\n2014). Deception \u201cis intentionally,\nknowingly, or purposefully misleading another person,\u201d whereas a lie\n\u201cis a subtype of deception that involves outright falsehood, which is\nconsciously known to be false by the teller, and is not signaled as false\nto the message recipient\u201d (Levine, 2014, p. 380). Based on the task in\nthis work, truth-tellers were unlikely to be tellingembedded lies, but\ninstead, they may have been tellingembedded deceptions.\nDrawing on IMT and other theoretical perspectives, prior work\nhas investigated different dynamics related to embedded deceptions.\nFor example, recent research has typically considered how details are\na cue of embeddedness. Verigin et al. (\n2020) had participants provide\nan alibi for a fictional crime and those instructed to provide an entirely\ntruthful statement had more details than those instructed to provide\nan entirely fabricated statement. However, lies embedded within\ncompletely truthful statements did not have more details than lies\nembedded within completely fabricated stories. Yet, other work has\nobserved that detailed information may be an important characteristic\nof embedded deceptions during a mock crime (e.g., liars discussed\npeople they met, places they went) (Nahari et al.,\n2014b). Embedded\ndeceptions and truths also occur interpersonally, as students who\ngave feedback on their peers' artwork and disliked it tended to over-\nstate positive aspects of the work and understate negative aspects of\nthe work, suggesting such accounts were mostly truthful (Bell &\nDePaulo,\n1996). Further, a recent study by Caso et al. (2023) had\ntruth-tellers, outright liars, and embedders (e.g., people who were told\nto tell the truth for half of a story and lie for the other half) communi-\ncate to an interviewer about a memorable life event that happened in\nthe last 12 months. Embedders spent more time and put in more\neffort to prepare their story for the interview than truth-tellers and\noutright liars. However, the number of complications in embedders'\nstatements (e.g., details that make a person's story more complicated,\nwhich are often found more often in truthful than deceptive speech;\nVrij et al.,\n2021) was not significantly different than truth-tellers and\noutright liars. Altogether, mixed evidence exists in term of the com-\nmunicative signals of embeddedness across different deception set-\ntings, yet the concept remains an important one to investigate for\nfrequency and social and psychological correlates.\nWhile prior research has evaluated how details reveal the charac-\nteristics of embedded deceptions/lies (Nahari et al.,\n2014b; Verigin\net al., 2020), and when people may communicate embedded decep-\ntions interpersonally (Bell & DePaulo,1996), few studies have evalu-\nated how often embeddedness generally occurs in false and truthful\nstatements. A related study found that people who assume fake iden-\ntifies only adjust \u201ca small portion\u201d of their true identity (e.g., small\nspelling variations of their true name) (Wang et al.,\n2004, p. 123). It is\ntherefore crucial to identify the distribution of embedded deceptions\nand truths in false and truthful communication because such informa-\ntion can aid deception detectors, law enforcement, or other\n2o f1 6 MARKOWITZ\n 10990720, 2024, 3, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acp.4215 by Cochrane Czech Republic, Wiley Online Library on [19/08/2025].

To build a deeper understanding of embeddedness, this\nrequires a basic description of how often and when this phenomenon\noccurs.\nIndeed, there is good reason to suspect that truth-tellers may\nembed deceptions in their truthful statements. For example, if telling\nan entirely truthful story is a problem (Levine,\n2020), truth-tellers may\ncovertly deceive in the form of exaggerations (e.g., if writing about\none's feelings toward another person, overstating how they feel), eva-\nsions (e.g., if writing about one's feelings toward another person,\ndodging how they feel by writing abstractly), or equivocations (e.g., if\nwriting about one's feelings toward another person, being non-\ncommittal or ambiguous about how they feel) (Levine,\n2014). These\nmay be done for self-presentation or face-saving purposes (Bell &\nDePaulo, 1996). The present work advances deception scholarship by\nevaluating embeddedness holistically \u2014particularly, how embedded\ndeceptions appear within entirely false and truthful statements, and\nhow embedded truths appear within entirely false and truthful\nstatements\u2014examining the frequency and social and psychological\ncorrelates of each. This leads to the first research question:\nRQ1. To what degree are false statements comprised of\nfalse and truthful communication patterns, and to what\ndegree are truthful statements comprised of false and\ntruthful communication patterns?\n1.3 | Individual differences in deception research\nBeyond distributions of embedded deceptions and truths, a critical\nnext step in this literature is the explication of who tends to systemat-\nically communicate embedded deceptions and truths. The current\nwork takes an individual differences approach to examine how dispo-\nsitional antecedents and defining internal traits about an individual\nrelate to embeddedness.\nSeveral individual differences are considered in the current paper\nbased on their connection to deception research at large. The first\ninterest focuses on aversive personality traits. Prior work suggests\nthose who are high on Machiavellianism (e.g., those who are manipu-\nlative), high on narcissism (e.g., those who believe they are superior to\nothers and entitled), and high or psychopathy (e.g., those who are low\non empathy and high on thrill-seeking) tend to cheat more (Jones &\nPaulhus,\n2017) and self-report more deception, on average (Daiku\net al., 2021; Furnham et al., 2013; Halevy et al., 2014;\nMarkowitz, 2023b). With such dispositional characteristics that are\noften connected to deception across settings (Jonason et al.,2014), it\nis therefore important to consider how aversive personality traits are\nalso linked to embedded deceiving and embedded truth-telling, which\nis an understudied empirical effort to date.\nAlongside personality measures, demographic traits often link to a\nvariety of deception dynamics as well. On average, younger people\ntend to lie more than older people (Levine et al.,\n2013;\nMarkowitz, 2023b; Serota & Levine,2015), men tend to lie more than\nwomen (Markowitz, 2023b; Serota & Levine,2015), and White indi-\nviduals self-report telling fewer lies than people of other racial/ethnic\ngroups (Markowitz,\n2023b; Serota et al., 2010). The relationship\nbetween political ideology and deception is more mixed and lie-type\ndependent, however. That is, Markowitz et al. ( 2023) suggested\npeople who are more conservative tend to self-report more big and\nserious lies (Study 2), but the relationship between conservatism and\nself-reported white lying was not statistically significant. Altogether,\nprior evidence indicates that demographics often matter in predicting\ndeception rates and deception dynamics, which motivated their evalu-\nation in this work.\nRelatedly, prior work suggests lying rates are not normally distrib-\nuted, and certain individuals (self-reportedly) tell a disproportionate\nnumber of lies in a population (Daiku et al.,\n2021; Halevy et al.,2014;\nLevine, 2014, 2020; Markowitz,2023b; Markowitz & Hancock,2018;\nSerota et al.,2010, 2022, 2024; Serota & Levine,2015). Individuals\nwho engage in prolific lying (vs those who engage in everyday lying)\ntend to be male, younger, and higher on aversive personality traits.\nHowever, it is unclear if one's status as a person who engages in pro-\nlific or everyday lying also indicates their rate of embedded deceiving\nor embedded truth-telling. This open question is examined in the cur-\nrent paper and represents another individual difference worth explor-\ning based on existing deception scholarship. The following research\nquestion between individual differences and embeddedness states:\nRQ2. What is the relationship between individual differ-\nences (e.g., aversive personality traits, demographics, one's\nprolific lying tendency) and embedded deceiving and\nembedded truth-telling?\n1.4 | Verbal traces of embeddedness: A\npsychology of language perspective\nThe final interest of this article\u2014beyond evaluating distributions of\nembedded deceptions and truths, and observing who tends to com-\nmunicate embedded deceptions and truths\u2014is an evaluation of how\nembedded deceptions and truths are communicated linguistically.\nThe current work applies principles from the psychology of language\nfield to address this idea. Research in the psychology of language\nt r a d i t i o nu s e sw o r d sa sm a r k e r so fo n e ' sf o c u sa n da t t e n t i o n\n(Boyd & Schwartz,\n2021;P e n n e b a k e r ,2011). For example, people\nwho use high rates of negative emotion terms (e.g., words such as\nhate, awful) areattending to a negative emotional state and focusing\ntheir attention on negativity . This approach has been well-\ne s t a b l i s h e di nt h es o c i a la n dp s y c h o l o g i c a ls c i e n c e s ,w i t hh u n d r e d s\nof studies suggesting that counting words can serve as an indication\nof how people are thinking, feeling, and experiencing the world psy-\nchologically (Boyd & Schwartz,\n2021;P e n n e b a k e re ta l . ,2003;\nTausczik & Pennebaker,2010).\nIndeed, deception is linked to language patterns as supported by\nmeta-analytic evidence. Hauch et al. (2015) evaluated over 40 studies\nusing computational approaches to analyze words and observed small,\nMARKOWITZ 3o f1 6\n 10990720, 2024, 3, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acp.4215 by Cochrane Czech Republic, Wiley Online Library on [19/08/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\n\n\nbut systematic links between deception and language. For example,\nthe evidence suggests lies often contain fewer words, more negative\nemotion, and fewer perceptual details than truths. It is important to\nremember that the data underlying these effects typically originate\nfrom studies evaluating bald-faced lies and bald-faced truths\n(e.g., entirely false or entirely truthful, respectively), and not the\nembedded components of a false or truthful statement\n(McCornack,\n1992; McCornack et al.,2014). A nontrivial advancement\nof the current study, then, is the linguistic explication of embedded\ndeceptions and embedded truths to understand how they are commu-\nnicated within false and truthful communication patterns.\nWhich language dimensions might matter to differentiate embed-\nded deceptions and embedded truths? Four language dimensions\nwere considered (and preregistered) in the current paper. The first\ndimension is overall affect and emotion, specifically discrete positive\nand negative emotions (happiness, anger, sadness, disgust, surprise,\nfear), and positive and negative sentiment or tone (Barrett,\n2017;\nBarrett et al.,2007). Primary study and meta-analytic evidence sug-\ngests lies often include more negative emotions than truths, perhaps\nto reflect an increase in guilt, embarrassment, or psychological dis-\ntancing during deception (Gino & Shea, 2012; Markowitz &\nGriffin, 2020; Newman et al.,2003). Lies may also contain more posi-\ntive emotions than truths to reflect the idea ofduping delight, where\npeople experience positive affect before or after telling a lie\n(Ekman,\n2001; Gunderson et al., 2022; ten Brinke & Porter,2012).\nGiven that emotion and affect are linked to deception in a range of\nstudies, the current work investigates how embeddedness is linked to\nemotion and affect as well.\nA second dimension of interest is self-references (e.g., words such\nas I, me, myself), which consider the degree to which people focus\ntheir attention on the self. Deception research often finds a system-\natic link between self-references and deception (Hauch et al.,\n2015;\nMarkowitz & Griffin,2020; Newman et al.,2003), with lies containing\na lower rate of\u201cI\u201d-words than truths, possibly explained by a psycho-\nlogical distancing mechanism as well. Lies can be interpersonally prob-\nlematic for people and communicating them can be stressful\n(Ekman,\n2001). This psychological experience can be revealed in the\nlanguage patterns of communicators through pronoun use and one's\nreduced focus on their own thoughts, feelings, and actions. It is\nunclear how one's self-focus is different across embedded deceptions\nand truths, which is why it is currently investigated in the\ncurrent work.\nThird, this work evaluated how one's communication style is\nlinked to deception through an analytic thinking index. Style words,\nalso known as function words, describehow one is communicating\n(e.g., \u201chow they put words together to create a message\u201d and ways of\nexpressing oneself through function words) rather thanwhat one is\ncommunicating about (e.g., the topic, Chung & Pennebaker,\n2007,\np. 345; Pennebaker, 2011). Common style words include articles\n(e.g., the, a), prepositions (e.g.,above, below), auxiliary verbs (e.g.,was,\nwere), and pronouns (e.g., me, they), and a recent paper suggests a\ngrouping of such word categories can approximate how people think\n(Pennebaker et al., 2014). That is, prior work evaluated student\nadmissions essays to university and explored the linguistic features\nmost systematically related to grades at the end of college\n(Pennebaker et al.,\n2014). Students with higher grades used more arti-\ncles and prepositions relative to storytelling words (e.g., pronouns,\nconjunctions) compared to students with lower grades. The authors\nconcluded that these individuals were more complex and analytic\nthinkers, and other work suggests people using high rates of such lan-\nguage patterns tend to be higher on need for cognition than those\nusing low rates of such language patterns (Markowitz,\n2023a). Indeed,\nresearch finds that deceptive communication patterns tend to be writ-\nten in a less analytic manner (e.g., fewer articles and prepositions) rela-\ntive to truthful communication patterns (Markowitz et al.,\n2021;\nMarkowitz & Hancock,2016), suggesting linguistic style via an ana-\nlytic thinking index is worth examining in association with\nembeddedness.\nFinally, deception research has a long history of evaluating the\nrate of details across false and truthful statements (Johnson &\nRaye, 1981; Markowitz & Hancock, 2014; Nahari, 2018; Nahari\net al.,2014b; Nahari et al.,2014a; Palena et al.,2021; Vrij,2008; Vrij,\nGranhag, & Porter,2010). According to a recent meta-analysis, truth-\ntellers report using more verifiable details in their statements than\nliars (Palena et al.,\n2021), but mixed primary study evidence exists in\nterms of how details are embedded across false and truthful state-\nments. The rate of adjectives, which is one marker to approximate the\namount of detail in a text (Chung & Pennebaker,\n2008; Markowitz &\nHancock, 2014), was examined in the current work. Together, the fol-\nlowing research question is posed for the collection of preregistered\nlanguage dimensions.\nRQ3. What is the relationship between language patterns\n(i.e., affect, self-references, analytic thinking, adjectives)\nand embedded deceptions and embedded truths?\n1.5 | The current study\nTo address the prior research questions\u2014and critically, to add to exist-\ning deception theory by articulating the distributions, communicator\ncharacteristics, and linguistic features of embedded deceptions and\ntruths\u2014a preregistered experiment was conducted using a large sam-\nple of online participants. People were randomly assigned to write\nfalse or truthful opinions about their friends, and then participants\nidentified the embedded deceptions and truths within their text. Indi-\nvidual differences were recruited, and automated text analyses were\nperformed on each participant's linguistic output, to assess who com-\nmunicates embedded deceptions and truths, and the linguistic associ-\nations with embeddedness, respectively.\nThis work is timely and important because the explication of sev-\neral features of embedded deceptions and truths are missing from the\ndeception literature (e.g., their rate, who tends to communicate them\nmost often, and how they are communicated verbally), but they\nremain theoretically necessary to deepen the concept of embedded-\nness in the field. Existing deception theory (e.g., IMT) and other\n4o f1 6 MARKOWITZ\n 10990720, 2024, 3, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acp.4215 by Cochrane Czech Republic, Wiley Online Library on [19/08/2025].

The present work is therefore a first step\nin advancing deception theory by considering distributions of false\n(or truthful) information within false (or truthful) communication, who\ncommunicates embedded deceptions and truths, and the verbal traces\nof embeddedness.\n2 | METHOD\n2.1 | Participants and power\nAn a priori power analysis estimating a small effect at 80%\npower (Cohen's d = 0.20, \u03b1 = .05, two-tailed) suggested 788 partici-\npants were required in this two-condition study. This power estimate\noriginates from meta-analytic evidence that suggests, on average, the\nrelationship between deception and language patterns yields small\nbut reliable effects (Hauch et al.,\n2015).\nA total of 800 US participants were recruited from Prolific and\nreceived $4.25 for their participation. Ten participants were excluded\nfor providing nonsensical responses (finalN = 790). Most participants\nself-identified as women (n = 398, 50.4%; menn = 377, 47.7%; other\nn = 14, 1.8%) and were 38.64 years old, on average\n(SD = 13.05 years). Most participants also self-identified as White\n(n = 581, 73.5%), with other race/ethnicities less represented in the\nsample. The sample and procedure were preregistered,\nhttps://\naspredicted.org/blind.php?x=T3N_BCY, and the project was\napproved by the (Redacted) University Institutional Review Board.\n2.2 | Procedure\nFollowing the procedure outlined in prior deception studies that has\nreliably solicited false or truthful statements from participants\n(DePaulo & Rosenthal,\n1979; Markowitz & Griffin, 2020; Newman\net al., 2003), people were randomly assigned to lie or tell the truth\nabout their friends. Participants wrote for a total of 5 minutes and\nafter this time, the survey platform automatically progressed, which\nintentionally created a consistent writing experience across partici-\npants. Those randomized to the truthful condition were given instruc-\ntions that stated:\nYour task is to write about your friends. We want you\nto talk about two friends that you like and two friends\nthat you do not like. It is important that you tell us your\ntruthful and honest views, as people may attempt to\nguess your true views.\nThose randomized to the deceptive condition were\ngiven instructions that stated:\nYour task is to write about your friends. We want you\nto talk about two friends that you like and two friends\nthat you do not like. However, we would like you to\ntalk about the people you like as if you do NOT like\nthem and talk about the people you do not as if you\nliked them.\nAfter the writing task, participants were told\u201cResearch suggests\nthere may be both truthful and deceptive parts of a message. In other\nwords, a message may not be fully truthful or fully deceptive\u201d and\nthey were instructed to indicate the parts of their text that were\ndeceptive and truthful. Participants were instructed to read left to\nright, and then copy and paste words, phrases, or sentences that were\ndeceptive or truthful into a maximum of 20 text boxes. The order of\nthis task (e.g., copying and pasting deceptive or truthful parts of each\nmessage) was randomized. Crucially, for proper grounding and consis-\ntent interpretation of dishonesty, participants were provided with a\ncommonly accepted definition of deception from the literature (\u201ca\ntext that is intentionally false or misleading \u201d) (Levine,\n2014;\nVrij, 2008).\nThree specific instructions for the copying and pasting process\nwere given. Verbatim, these instructions stated: (1) You will go\nthrough your text, copying and pasting the phrases or full sentences\nthat were either deceptive or truthful (depending on the instruc-\ntions). You will do this for up to 20 pieces of text. (2) If you have\nmultiple deceptions or truths in one sentence, please place them on\ndifferent lines (different text boxes). (3) After you copy and paste a\npiece of text, you will rate each statement on a scale of (1) Not at all\ndeceptive (or truthful) to (5) Extremely deceptive (or truthful). To\nensure participants copied and pasted texts correctly, an example of\nthis process was provided (see the online supplement out of space\nconsiderations). Alongside each text that was copied and pasted,\nparticipants rated the deceptiveness or truthfulness of each state-\nment on a 5-point scale (1 = Not at all [truthful/deceptive] to\n5 = Extremely [truthful/deceptive]) that was derived from prior\nwork (Markowitz & Hancock,\n2018). High scores were intended to\nbe high ratings of deceptiveness and therefore, all ratings on the\ntruthful scale were reverse-scored.\n2.3 | Measures\n2.3.1 | Embedded deceiving and truth-telling rates\nAn embedded deceiving rate and embedded truth-telling rate were\ncreated by identifying the number of statements that participants\ncopied and pasted in their evaluation of embedded deceptions and\ntruths, and dividing this number by 20 (i.e., the total number of text\nboxes provided).\ni Therefore, each person received two embeddedness\nrates, the main dependent variables of this work. An example of how\nthe embeddedness rates were calculated, using an excerpt from a par-\nticipant's writing, is in the online supplement out of space\nconsiderations.\nMARKOWITZ 5o f1 6\n 10990720, 2024, 3, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acp.4215 by Cochrane Czech Republic, Wiley Online Library on [19/08/2025].

Two questions asked,\n\u201cOn average, how many times a day do you tell a [little white/big]\nlie?\u201d with 10 scale points: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25+. All 25+\nresponses were recoded as 25.\nRecall, prior work suggests participants can be categorized into\nthose who engage in prolific lying and those who engage in everyday\nlying by analyzing their self-reported lying rates (Markowitz,\n2023b;\nSerota & Levine,2015). This is accomplished statistically by creating\nan index of dispersion, which is calculated by dividing the variance of\nthe measure by the mean of that same measure, removing cases at\nthe right-hand tail of a distribution until the value approximates 1.0\n(D;\u22481). That is, whenD\u22481, this is the pivot point at which two sub-\nsamples are created (e.g., separating those who engage in prolific lying\non the right-hand tail from those who engage in everyday lying). Peo-\nple who engaged in prolific white lying self-reported telling more than\n5 white lies (D = 1.09) and people who engaged in prolific big lying\nself-reported telling more than 2 big lies (D = 1.07). In contrast, those\nwho engaged in everyday white lying reported telling 5 or fewer white\nlies and those who engaged in everyday big lying reported telling 2 or\nfewer big lies. This process occurred to identify if the rate and charac-\nteristics of embedded deceptions and truths differed by those who\nengaged in prolific lying.\n2.3.3 | The dark triad\nThree aversive personality traits, known as The Dark Triad, were mea-\nsured using a 27-item scale from prior work (Jones & Paulhus,\n2014).\nThe subscales of Machiavellianism (Cronbach's\u03b1 = 0.79), narcissism\n(Cronbach's \u03b1 = 0.82), and psychopathy (Cronbach's\u03b1 = 0.75) were\nhighly reliable. Please see the online supplement for sample items out\nof space considerations.\n2.3.4 | Demographics\nAge, gender (3 levels: man, woman, other), race/ethnicity (6 levels:\nWhite, Black/African American, Asian, American Indian, Native\nHawaiian, Other), and a 7-point measure of political ideology were\nassessed (1= extremely liberal, 7= extremely conservative).\n2.4 | Automated text analysis\nThe automated text analysis tool, Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count\n(LIWC: Pennebaker et al., 2022), evaluated all texts in this study.\nLIWC counts words as a percentage of the total word count per text.\nFor example, the statement\u201cI dislike my friend\u201d contains four words,\nand LIWC counts several words within its internal dictionary of social\n(e.g., words related to friends), psychological (e.g., words related to\nemotion, cognition), and part of speech dimensions (e.g., articles, pro-\nnouns). From the prior statement, LIWC identified self-references\n(e.g., I, my; 50% of the total word count), negative emotion terms\n(e.g., dislike; 25% of the total word count), and friends-related words\n(25% of the total word count), and this process was repeated for\neach text.\nAs noted, four verbal dimensions were used to evaluate the lin-\nguistic differences between embedded deceptions and truths:\n(1) affect, which is a global category that includes positive and\nnegative emotions (e.g., words such as happy, sad), plus positive\nand negative sentiment/tone (e.g., words such as birthday, coffin),\n(2) self-references (e.g., \u201cI\u201d words), which indicate a person's self-focus\nand attention (3) the rate ofanalytic thinking, which indicates a per-\nson's formal and complex thinking style (Jordan et al.,\n2019;\nMarkowitz, 2023a; Pennebaker et al.,2014),ii and (4)adjectives, which\nindicate the descriptiveness of one's verbal output (Chung &\nPennebaker,\n2008). Prior evidence suggests these language dimen-\nsions are often related to deception (e.g., Hauch et al., 2015;\nJohnson & Raye, 1981; Markowitz & Hancock,2014, 2016; Verigin\net al.,2020), which motivated their inclusion in the current article.\n3 | RESULTS\nDescriptive statistics and bivariate correlations across key measures\nare in Table1.\n3.1 | Manipulation check\nPrior work using the friends prompt suggests deceivers tend to use\nfewer self-references and more negative emotion in their overall writ-\ning compared to truth-tellers (Markowitz & Griffin,\n2020; Newman\net al.,2003). These patterns were confirmed in the current sample, as\nparticipants instructed to deceive about their friends used a lower rate\nof self-references ( M = 6.39%, SD = 3.66%) than participants\ninstructed to tell the truth about their friends ( M = 7.65%,\nSD = 3.35%), Welch's t(757.81) = /C05.05, p < .001, Cohen'sd = 0.36.\nParticipants instructed to deceive about their friends used a higher\nrate of negative emotion terms (M = 1.18%, SD = 1.15%) than partici-\npants instructed to tell the truth about their friends (M = 0.68%,\nSD = 0.93%), Welch's t(715.26) = 6.72, p < .001, Cohen's d = 0.48.\nThese patterns confirm that participants responded in ways that prior\nwork expects psychologically (e.g., Hauch et al.,\n2015).\n3.2 | Embeddedness frequency and ratings\nAs described in Table 2, participants randomized to the deception\ncondition reported more embedded deceptions (37.06%) than partici-\npants randomized to tell the truth (29.21%). Those randomized to tell\n6o f1 6 MARKOWITZ\n 10990720, 2024, 3, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acp.4215 by Cochrane Czech Republic, Wiley Online Library on [19/08/2025].

Please see the top and bottom\npanels of Figure 1 for visualizations of the embeddedness distribu-\ntions across conditions.\nRecall, participants also rated the deceptiveness of each embed-\nded deception or truth on a 5-point Likert-type scale. After controlling\nfor condition as a fixed effect in a linear mixed model and participant\nas a random intercept, embedded deceptions (M = 3.70, SE = 0.03)\nhad a greater deceptiveness rating than embedded truths (M = 3.62,\nSE = 0.03), t = 3.99, p < .001. Therefore, embedded deceptions\u2014\nregardless of whether people were instructed to tell deceptions or\ntruths about their friends\u2014were rated as more extreme on the state-\nment level than embedded truths.\n3.3 | Links to the dark triad\nIn a multiple regression controlling for condition, embedded deceiving\nwas not statistically associated with narcissism (B = /C00.88, SE = 1.18,\nt = /C00.74, p = .460), Machiavellianism (B = 0.65, SE = 1.19, t = 0.55,\np = .586), nor psychopathy (B = /C00.87, SE = 1.36, t = /C00.64, p = .523).\nEmbedded truth-telling was also not statistically associated with\nnarcissism ( B = /C01.38, SE = 1.19, t = /C01.15, p = .250),\nMachiavellianism (B = /C01.10, SE = 1.19, t = /C00.92, p = .359), nor psy-\nchopathy (B = /C02.09, SE = 1.37, t = /C01.52, p = .129). No exploratory\ninteraction effects emerged between Dark Triad traits and condition\nto predict rates of embedded deceiving or truth-telling. Altogether,\nembeddedness was statistically unrelated to aversive personality\ntraits.\n3.4 | Demographic links to embeddedness\n3.4.1 | Age\nIn a multiple regression model controlling for condition, age was not\nstatistically associated with the embedded deceiving rate (B = 0.03,\nSE = 0.07, t = 0.45, p = .652) nor the embedded truth-telling rate\n(B = 0.09, SE = 0.07, t = 1.44, p = .151).v\n3.4.2 | Gender\nGender was not statistically associated with the embedded deceiving\nrate, F(1, 772)= 2.59, p = .108, but it was statistically associated with\nthe embedded truth-telling rate,F(1, 772)= 7.93, p = .005.

The models contained a fixed effect for the type of\nembeddedness (embedded deceiving vs. embedded truth-telling), con-\ndition (lying vs. truth-telling), and a random intercept for participant to\ncontrol for data non-independence.\nThe only language dimension that was significantly linked to\nembeddedness was analytic thinking [F(1, 11447.2)= 4.17, p = .041],\nwhere embedded truths (M = 30.30, SE = 0.61) had a more analytic\nand formal style than embedded deceptions (M = 29.00, SE = 0.64).\nExploratory bivariate correlations between embeddedness and other\nLIWC variables are offered in the supplement out of transparency\nconcerns and space considerations.\n3.7 | Exploratory results\nPerhaps one surprising result is the amount of overlap between\nembedded deceptions and embedded truths across conditions (results\naddressing RQ1). It is therefore important to investigate the source of\nthis overlap at the language level to possibly describe why these dif-\nferences (or lack thereof) occurred.\nTo accomplish this aim, embedded deceptions and embedded\ntruths were independently submitted to the Meaning Extraction\nMethod for each condition (Chung & Pennebaker, 2008;\nMarkowitz, 2021). This technique uses Principal Component Analysis\nto identify how content words cluster statistically after varimax rota-\ntion. The approach, which first removes style words (e.g., articles,\nprepositions, pronouns) and low base-rate words to prepare for the\nanalysis of content words, has received robust support in communica-\ntion research and psychology as a way to systematically evaluate\nthemes and topics from large text collections (Blackburn et al.,\n2018;\nChung & Pennebaker, 2008; Fauville et al., 2023; Markowitz &\nSlovic, 2020; Pham et al., 2023; Ramirez-esparza et al., 2008;\nRubaltelli et al., 2023). Consistent with prior work (Foxman\net al., 2021; Markowitz, 2021), the number of extracted themes was\ndetermined by a combination of scree plot evidence, variance\nexplained (e.g., each additional theme should contribute a nontrivial\namount of added variance), and thematic interpretability. Words\nretained in each analysis were unigrams (single words), and they must\nhave appeared in at least 5% of all texts per corpus to be considered\nfor meaning extraction.\nThe evidence in Tables\n3\u20136 displays various extracted themes\nacross the four combinations of condition (deceptive vs. truthful text)\nand embeddedness (embedded deceptions vs. embedded truths). In\nthe truthful condition, embedded truths (Table\n3) discussed personal\nand positive characteristics about a friend and the relationship\n(e.g., having asense of humor, sharing interests, and the friend being\nfunny and smart). Embedded truths in the truthful condition were also\nmore experiential in nature and related to place (e.g., where people\nmet their friend, such as inhigh school). Critically, embedded decep-\ntions in the truthful condition (Table4) were abstractly written and\nbroadly discussed how or when people met their friend (e.g.,met best\nfriend), including generalities about having things in common\nFIGURE 2 Prolific big lying/C2\nCondition interaction effect\npredicting embedded lying.

Embedded truths were descriptively more concrete,\nwhereas embedded deceptions were more descriptively abstract, gen-\neral, or canned (e.g., the embedded deceptions were non-specific and\nbroad enough that any person could have written them).\nIn the deception condition, themes across embedded truths and\ndeceptions were more consistent. That is, embedded truths in the\ndeception condition (Table\n5) mentioned people spending time\ntogether (Component 1) and general ideas about friendship\n(Component 3). Embedded deceptions in the deception condition\n(Table\n6) also mentioned the theme of time together (Component\n2, Component 3) and friendship as well (Component 4). The content\nof embedded deceptions and truths were notably more similar in the\ndeception condition than the content of embedded deceptions and\ntruths in the truthful condition.\nAltogether, the thematic extraction results comport well with other\nembeddedness findings reported in this paper. That is, prior evidence\nsuggested that only among those randomly assigned to tell the truth\nwere rates of embedded truths and deceptions significantly different,\nand there was more embeddedness overlap among those assigned to\ntell a deceptive statement. At the thematic and language level, there\nwas more content-related variability among embedded truths and\ndeceptions for those in the truthful condition, but less so for those in\nthe deception condition. This suggests that embeddedness signals\u2014 in\nterms of frequency and linguistic thematic signature\u2014 might be more\ndiscernable for truthful statements compared to deceptive statements,\nevidence which may aid deception detection and provide a more\nrefined understanding of embeddedness at a theoretical level.\nTABLE 3 Meaning extraction\nmethod results for embedded truths in\nthe truthful condition.\nComponent 1: Component 2: Component 3: Component 4:\nHigh school Humor Interests Positive characteristics\n\u03bb % \u03bb % \u03bb % \u03bb %\n2.03 3.45 1.98 3.36 1.97 3.34 1.68 2.85\nWord Loading Word Loading Word Loading Word Loading\nSchool 0.847 Sense 0.887 Interests 0.804 Funny 0.681\nHigh 0.835 Humor 0.850 Share 0.621 Smart 0.449\nPerson 0.339 Fun 0.374\nEnjoy 0.357\nCaring 0.319\nSupportive /C00.415\nNote: Numbers in the\u03bb column represent eigenvalues.

Upon writing false or truthful opinions about\ntheir friends, participants reflected on their messages for embedded\ndeceptions and truths. The rate of embedded deceiving and truth-\ntelling were not statistically different among those who wrote false\nstatements about their friends, but among those who wrote truthful\nstatements about their friends, they reported more embedded truths\nthan deceptions (addressing\nRQ1). This is some of the first evidence of\nits kind to reveal the compositional elements of false and truthful\ncommunication patterns. In addition to evaluating rates of embedded\ndeceptions and truths, this work considered who communicates\nembedded deceptions and truths (addressing\nRQ2) and the linguistic\ncharacteristics of embeddedness (addressingRQ3). Embedded truths\nwere often written by women and liberals, suggesting individual dif-\nferences linked to embeddedness. Embedded truths were also written\nin a more formal and analytical manner than embedded deceptions.\nThis study adds to our basic theoretical understanding of decep-\ntion production in several ways. First, to date, assumptions about the\ndistributions of embeddedness within false and truthful messages\nhave largely been untested. Now, the current work suggests that rates\nof embedded deceptions and truths are different among truthful mes-\nsages, but not false messages. Therefore, not only is the bald-faced lie\nand bald-faced truth dichotomy largely inaccurate for deception\nresearch (McCornack,\n1992; McCornack et al., 2014; Verigin\net al., 2020), but rates of embeddedness are also a function of mes-\nsage type (e.g., false messages will not universally have more embed-\nded deceptions than truths). This result has critical implications for the\nstudy of deception because it suggests deceptions and truths are\nindeed comprised of false and truthful communication data, but only\ntruthful messages show enough separability between the number of\nembedded deceptions and truths that are within each text. This result\naffirms critical assumptions of many deception theories\n(e.g., deceptions and truths draw on a common pool of communica-\ntion data; Markowitz,\n2020; McCornack et al., 2014; Walczyk\net al.,2014), putting actual data to theoretical ideas. Together, it may\nbe methodologically convenient to consider lies and truths as\ncompletely deceptive or truthful, but this work suggests the communi-\ncation of veracity is more nuanced and layered.\nIt is important to recall that this piece did not aim to provide a\nuniversal rate of embedded deceptions and truths that would occur\nwithin any false or truthful message. Instead, it aimed to suggest a\npossible distribution of embedded deceptions and truths in such mes-\nsage types. With other prompts, settings, writing topics, and calcula-\ntions of embeddedness, absolute rates of embedded deceptions and\ntruths will indeed change. However, this work is critical because it\nindicates how embeddedness differences are a function of veracity.\nFuture work should seek to replicate these ideas without explicit\nveracity prompting as well.\nA critical follow-up question to the present results asks: Why did\ntruth-tellers include embedded deceptions? While a definitive answer\nto this question is unobtainable, the automated thematic extraction\nresults suggested that these deceptions were quite broad, non-\nspecific, and abstract compared to embedded truths. There are several\npossible reasons for deceptions to appear within truthful statements.\nFirst, as noted, truth-tellers may embed deceptions in the form of\nexaggerations, evasions, or equivocations, particularly for\nself-presentation purposes (e.g., participants may have deceived by\nexaggerating how great of friends they have, presumably to appear\nlikeable) or for face-saving purposes (e.g., participants may have\ndeceived by equivocating about why they dislike certain people)\n(Bell & DePaulo,\n1996). Unfortunately, the present data do not allow\nfor an analysis to understand the precise motivations behind embed-\nded deceiving or truth-telling, despite the finding that suggests they\nhave a different linguistic signature in terms of content. However, as\nothers suggests (DePaulo,\n1992; Levine, 2019), the reasons for lying\nand truth-telling may often be similar (e.g., people often want to make\na favorable impression when lyingand truth-telling), suggesting it is an\nopportunity for future work to examine if motivations are differential\nacross embeddedness, and under which settings or conditions are\nembedded deceptions told at various rates.\nThe fact that we now know, under conditions related to certain\nwriting tasks and certain samples, that embeddedness rates are\nTABLE 6 Meaning extraction\nmethod results for embedded deceptions\nin the deceptive condition.\nComponent 1: Component 2: Component 3: Component 4:\nHard work Time together Hanging together Best friend\n\u03bb % \u03bb % \u03bb % \u03bb %\n1.65 4.72 1.62 4.63 1.56 4.46 1.45 4.15\nWord Loading Word Loading Word Loading Word Loading\nMoney 0.711 Spend 0.747 Hang 0.658 Best 0.684\nWork 0.679 Time 0.680 Trying 0.608 Friend 0.581\nHard 0.450 Annoying 0.394 Find 0.586 Person 0.432\nAnnoying 0.227 Love 0.424\nNote: Numbers in the\u03bb column represent eigenvalues.

A critical area of research in deception detection is the\nuse of details (Johnson & Raye,\n1981; Markowitz & Hancock,2014;\nNahari, 2018; Nahari et al., 2014a; Nahari et al., 2014b; Palena\net al., 2021; Vrij, 2008; Vrij, Granhag, & Porter,2010). The current\nstudy may imply that detail-related differences are only relevant\namong those who are telling the truth, requiring scholars to rethink\nhow deception production (e.g., how false and truthful statements are\ncomprised of false and truthful elements) and deception detection\nresearch inform each other (e.g., when to look for differences in rates\nof false and truthful communication among suspected false and truth-\nful statements). Perhaps this work can inform law enforcement prac-\ntices during interrogations, including the types of verbal traces that\nidentify embedded deceptions or embedded truths. Having law\nenforcement and other institutions take language patterns seriously,\nincluding one's own linguistic style to indicate embeddedness, is an\noutcome that can possibly be implemented in real-time with natural\nlanguage processing techniques.\nSecond, by indicating personal characteristics of those who tell\nembedded deceptions and truths, this work further deepens an argu-\nment that individual differences matter in deception research and link\nto dynamics like embeddedness. While many demographic traits\nlinked to embeddedness (e.g., gender, political ideology), aversive per-\nsonality traits did not. That narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psy-\nchopathy linked to self-reported lying rates in expected ways\n(Table\n1), but did not associate with embeddedness, suggests the prior\nnull effects are unlikely related to measurement issues. Instead,\nembeddedness may be linked to some individual differences\n(e.g., demographics) and prolific lying, but not others (e.g., personality).\nThird, by examining how embeddedness was associated with lan-\nguage, the current study explicates how embedded deceptions and\ntruths are constructed verbally. There are several points worth under-\nscoring about the relationship between embeddedness and language.\nFirst, the null finding between adjectives and embeddedness repli-\ncates a prior study that found lies embedded within complete truths\nwere not more detailed than lies within complete falsehoods (Verigin\net al.,\n2020). On average, truths tend to have more verifiable details\nthan lies (Palena et al.,2021), but mixed evidence exists in terms of\nembeddedness. These non-uniform and often conflicting findings\nrequire that future work continues to examine the relationship\nbetween verbal communication (e.g., adjectives) and embedded\ndeceiving. A second point worthy of explication relates to the system-\natic relationship between analytic thinking and embeddedness. This\nstudy observed that embedded truths were more analytical and for-\nmal than embedded deceptions (e.g., more articles and prepositions\nrelative to storytelling words like pronouns), a pattern generally con-\nsistent with deception literature that has considered complete truths\nand complete lies (Markowitz et al.,\n2021; Markowitz &\nHancock, 2016). It appears that some language dimensions are linked\nto veracity at complete and embedded levels of analysis, an idea that\nshould also be explored with more verbal dimensions.\nFinally, it is worth commenting on the results offered in Table2.\nA critical reader might suggest that the amount of overlap across\ndeceptive and truthful embedded messages is curious. Considering\nthe typical effect sizes in deception and language studies\u2014plus, the\nsupport from IMT, which argues that lies and truths draw from a com-\nmon source of linguistic information\u2014these differences are indeed\nreasonable. Recall, Hauch et al. (\n2015) observed that there are small,\nyet reliable associations between deception and language. Effect size\ndifferences between conditions in this study (Table\n2) are consistent\nwith this meta-analytic summary. Therefore, the amount of overlap\nbetween embedded deceptions and truths across conditions is consis-\ntent with expectations from theory and prior work on the linguistic\ntraces of deception, yet predominantly revealed by those who were\ninstructed to tell the truth. The source of this overlap, as revealed in\nthe exploratory thematic analyses, is also at least partially explained\nby topical similarities and differences across embedded deceptions\nand truths. Since participants were asked to write about the same\ngeneral topic (i.e., their friends), it is reasonable that they would report\nsome similar themes among sanctioned deceptions (e.g., negative\nexperiences with a friend, how two people met). Yet, there were criti-\ncal differences that betrayed embedded deceptions and truths among\nthose who were told to tell the truth. Future work would benefit from\nfurther exploring the linguistic similarities and differences across\nembedded deceptions and truths to identify more nuance in the pool\nof information that people draw on for their communication output.\nThe remainder of a person's language patterns\u2014aside from embedded\ndeceptions and truths among false and truthful statements\u2014is also\nworth investigating.\n4.1 | Limitations and future directions\nThe current work only had participants provide one piece of writing\nusing a relatively benign topic. As one of the first studies to evaluate\nrates of embeddedness, characteristics of communicators related to\nembeddedness, and linguistic traits of embeddedness, using a vali-\ndated writing exercise from prior work was intentional (DePaulo &\nRosenthal,\n1979; Markowitz & Griffin,2020; Newman et al.,2003).\nPlus, this study attempted to keep the effort burden low for partici-\npants and within funding limitations, which constrained the amount of\nwriting time and topics that could be addressed in the work. There-\nfore, obtaining multiple writing samples across a diversity of topics\u2014\nand if using the friends prompt in the future, dividing the prompt into\ntwo separate tasks or experimental conditions: (a) write about some-\none you dislike as if you liked them vs. (b) write about someone you\nlike as if you do not\u2014would benefit this line of work and help to\nassess the generalizability of the findings. For example, if people were\ntold to discuss alleged activities instead of opinions, the pattern of\nresults may be less clear. This is an open empirical question that\nshould be addressed in future research.\nAnother limitation is that, like most deception studies\n(Levine,\n2018), participants were instructed to lie or tell the truth\n(e.g., sanctioned lying), which might deviate from their normal or\neveryday behavior. Sanctioned lying is often a constraint of deception\nresearch, which does not take away from the current empirical pack-\nage nor its findings, but still requires acknowledgement. Future work\ncould collect observational data (e.g., text messages) and have\n12 of 16 MARKOWITZ\n 10990720, 2024, 3, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acp.4215 by Cochrane Czech Republic, Wiley Online Library on [19/08/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\n\n\nparticipants retrospectively rate their communication data for embed-\nded deceptions and truths. This comparison would help to ensure that\nsanctioned versus unsanctioned lying patters as they relate to\nembeddedness are consistent.\nWhile prior deception research was used as a foundation to con-\nsider the communicator characteristics (e.g., individual differences)\nand language dimensions of interest in the current work, there are\nothers that may warrant inclusion in the future. For example, prior\nwork suggests people are often opportunistic cheaters and deceivers\n(Ariely,\n2012; Kouchaki & Smith,2014; Markowitz & Levine,2021).\nPeople deceive when the truth is a problem and when an opportunity\nfor deception is present with something to gain (Ariely,\n2012;\nLevine, 2020; Markowitz & Levine,2021). It may be helpful to exam-\nine if one's tendency to behave deceptively on one-off tasks is predic-\ntive of embedded deceiving or truth-telling, or if a person's embedded\ndeceiving (or truth-telling) rate in one setting is associated with their\nembedded deceiving (or truth-telling) rate in another setting (or, as\nothers like Serota et al.,\n2022 question, if one's prolific lying status is\nconsistent over time). The contextual similarities and constraints of a\ndeception setting are also worth investigating as they relate to\nembedded deceiving (Markowitz et al., 2023; Markowitz &\nHancock, 2019), since prior work suggests that elements ofthe con-\ntext (e.g., psychological dynamics, pragmatic goals, genre conventions,\ndispositional factors, situational factors, interpersonal factors) can\nshape how deception affects language. Altogether, while this current\nwork has pushed the concept of embeddedness forward in new ways,\nfuture research would benefit from taking this idea more seriously in\nthe deception literature to understand its social, psychological, and\ncultural antecedents and consequences.\nFinally, when participants indicated their embedded deceptions,\nthey did not rate the severity of such messages (e.g., as a little white\nlie or a big lie) beyond a simple Likert-type scale rating of deceptive-\nness. Future work might have participants rate embedded deceptions\nfor lie type severity to understand how different lie types are commu-\nnicated and with various linguistic characteristics. Asking participants\nto report their self-estimated percentages of truth telling and lying\nmay also provide additional information to understand how embedd-\nedness is a clear or conscious concept for people to report in decep-\ntion studies.\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\nThe author reports no conflicts of interest with the publication of this\nresearch.\nDATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT\nThe data that support the findings of this study are available on\nrequest from the corresponding author. The data are not publicly\navailable due to privacy or ethical restrictions.\nENDNOTES\ni Since participants rated both embedded deceptions and embedded\ntruths regardless of their experimental condition, any differences in one's\ncopying and pasting procedure were at least consistent within-\nparticipant.\nii Analytic thinking is a composite variable of seven LIWC style-word cate-\ngories. The formula is: (articles+ prepositions /C0pronouns /C0auxiliary\nverbs /C0adverb /C0conjunctions \u2013 negations) (Jordan et al.,\n2019). Raw\ncounts are \u201cconverted to percentiles based on standardized scores from\nlarge comparison corpora,\u201d where then high scores indicate a more formal\nand complex thinking style compared to low scores (Boyd et al.,2022).\niii Crucially, even if embeddedness was considered as the percentage of\nstatements that were deceptive or truthful (out of 20 total statements),\nor as the number of words from the embedded statements as a percent-\nage of a person's total writing output, the results were consistent. Please\nsee the supplement for results using word count percentage.\niv R2m = variance explained by fixed effects only in a linear mixed model\ncalculation. R2c = variance explained by fixed and random effects in a\nlinear mixed model calculation. The MuMIn package was used for these\ncalculations (Barto\u0144,\n2020).\nv However, consistent with prior work (Markowitz, 2023b; Serota &\nLevine, 2015), age was significantly associated with overall white lying\nfrequency ( r = /C0.156, p < .001) and overall big lying frequency\n(r = /C0.116, p = .001).\nREFERENCES\nAmado, B.
