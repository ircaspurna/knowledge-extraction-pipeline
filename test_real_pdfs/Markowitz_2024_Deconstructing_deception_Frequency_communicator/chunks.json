Markowitz, Department of\nCommunication, Michigan State University,\nEast Lansing, MI 48824, USA. Email:\ndmm@msu.edu\nAbstract\nDeceptive and truthful statements draw on a common pool of communication data,\nand they are typically embedded within false and truthful narratives. How often does\nembeddedness occur, who communicates embedded deceptions and truths, and\nwhat linguistic characteristics reveal embeddedness?\n\nIn this study, nearly 800 partici-\npants deceived or told the truth about their friends and indicated the embedded\ndeceptions (e.g., false statements told within entirely false or truthful messages) and\ntruths (e.g., truthful statements told within entirely false or truthful messages). Embedded deceiving and truth-telling rates were only statistically different among\nthose who were instructed to tell the truth. Therefore, the distribution of embedded\ndeceptions and truths were similar for false statements, but dissimilar for truthful\nstatements.",

      "text": "deception theory\nThe idea that deceptive and truthful messages are not completely\ndeceptive nor completely truthful is supported by Information Manip-\nulation Theory (McCornack,\n1992). The theory presupposes that much\nof deception research has rested on a bald-faced lie and bald-faced\ntruth dichotomy, which is inconsistent with how people actually tell\nlies and truths (Bond & DePaulo,\n2006; McCornack, 1997; Sporer &\nSchwandt, 2007; Verigin et al.,2020). Instead, McCornack and col-\nleagues argue that when people interact, they often abide by several\nconversational rules that are inherently cooperative in nature\n(Grice,\n1989).\n\nThese rules, called Grice's Maxims, are of great interest\nto deception scholars when cooperationdoes not occur(Grice, 1975,\n1989). That is, such covert violations of Gricean maxims of quantity\n(e.g., the amount of information), quality (e.g., the truthfulness of the\ninformation), manner (e.g., how the information is communicated), and\nrelation (e.g., the relevance of the information) constitute information\nmanipulation in various forms (Markowitz,\n2020; McCornack, 1992;\nMcCornack et al., 2014). For example, as others indicate\n(Levine, 2001), lying by omission violates the maxim of quantity, and\nlying by equivocation violates the maxim of manner.",

Embedded truths were also written\nin a more formal and analytical manner than embedded deceptions. This study adds to our basic theoretical understanding of decep-\ntion production in several ways. First, to date, assumptions about the\ndistributions of embeddedness within false and truthful messages\nhave largely been untested. Now, the current work suggests that rates\nof embedded deceptions and truths are different among truthful mes-\nsages, but not false messages. Therefore, not only is the bald-faced lie\nand bald-faced truth dichotomy largely inaccurate for deception\nresearch (McCornack,\n1992; McCornack et al., 2014; Verigin\net al., 2020), but rates of embeddedness are also a function of mes-\nsage type (e.g., false messages will not universally have more embed-\nded deceptions than truths). This result has critical implications for the\nstudy of deception because it suggests deceptions and truths are\nindeed comprised of false and truthful communication data, but only\ntruthful messages show enough separability between the number of\nembedded deceptions and truths that are within each text.",

On average, truths tend to have more verifiable details\nthan lies (Palena et al.,2021), but mixed evidence exists in terms of\nembeddedness. These non-uniform and often conflicting findings\nrequire that future work continues to examine the relationship\nbetween verbal communication (e.g., adjectives) and embedded\ndeceiving. A second point worthy of explication relates to the system-\natic relationship between analytic thinking and embeddedness.\n\nThis\nstudy observed that embedded truths were more analytical and for-\nmal than embedded deceptions (e.g., more articles and prepositions\nrelative to storytelling words like pronouns), a pattern generally con-\nsistent with deception literature that has considered complete truths\nand complete lies (Markowitz et al.,\n2021; Markowitz &\nHancock, 2016).

The formula is: (articles+ prepositions /C0pronouns /C0auxiliary\nverbs /C0adverb /C0conjunctions \u2013 negations) (Jordan et al.,\n2019). Raw\ncounts are \u201cconverted to percentiles based on standardized scores from\nlarge comparison corpora,\u201d where then high scores indicate a more formal\nand complex thinking style compared to low scores (Boyd et al.,2022).\n\niii Crucially, even if embeddedness was considered as the percentage of\nstatements that were deceptive or truthful (out of 20 total statements),\nor as the number of words from the embedded statements as a percent-\nage of a person's total writing output, the results were consistent. Please\nsee the supplement for results using word count percentage. iv R2m = variance explained by fixed effects only in a linear mixed model\ncalculation. R2c = variance explained by fixed and random effects in a\nlinear mixed model calculation. The MuMIn package was used for these\ncalculations (Barto\u0144,\n2020). v However, consistent with prior work (Markowitz, 2023b; Serota &\nLevine, 2015), age was significantly associated with overall white lying\nfrequency ( r = /C0.156, p < .001) and overall big lying frequency\n(r = /C0.116, p = .001).",
