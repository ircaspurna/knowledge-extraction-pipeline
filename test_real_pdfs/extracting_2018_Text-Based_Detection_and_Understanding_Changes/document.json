Wilson\nUniversity of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA\n{yaoyiran,mihalcea,steverw}@umich.edu\nAbstract. Previous work has investigated the identi\ufb01cation of mental health is-\nsues in social media users, yet the way that users\u2019 mental states and related\nbehavior change over time remains relatively understudied. This paper focuses\non online mental health communities and studies how users\u2019 contributions to\nthese communities change over one year. We de\ufb01ne a metric called the Mental\nHealth Contribution Index (MHCI), which we use to measure the degree to which\nusers\u2019 contributions to mental health topics change over a one-year period. In this\nwork, we study the relationship between MHCI scores and the online expression\nof mental health symptoms by extracting relevant linguistic features from user-\ngenerated content and conducting statistical analyses. Additionally, we build a\nclassi\ufb01er to predict whether or not a user\u2019s contributions to mental health sub-\nreddits will increase or decrease. Finally, we employ propensity score matching\nto identify factors that correlate with an increase or a decrease in mental health\nforum contributions. Our work provides some of the \ufb01rst insights into detecting\nand understanding social media users\u2019 changes in mental health states over time.\nKeywords: Natural Language Processing \u00b7Mental Health \u00b7Social Media\n1 Introduction and Related Work\nMental health issues pose a major challenge for modern society [6, 23, 5] and early\ndetection and intervention are fundamental to preventing the progression of mental ill-\nnesses [32, 38, 55, 27, 26, 1, 49]. To aid the work already being done by medical prac-\ntitioners, social media data are increasingly being used to analyze and predict mental\nillnesses [31, 42, 22, 14, 39, 43, 3, 15, 28]. As much of the data shared by users on so-\ncial media is unstructured text, language attributes have proven to be effective features\nfor the analysis and prediction of mental health states of social media users [37, 13,\n2, 35, 11, 40, 51]. In this paper, we focus on the discussion website, Reddit 1, where\nuser-generated content is organized into topical, user-created boards called \u201csubred-\ndits\u201d. Previous work has studied mental health-related (MH) subreddits in terms of self-\ndisclosure, social support and anonymity [22, 43]. Prior work has also focused on both\nthe detection and prediction of mental health problems using social media data [51, 17,\n19, 40]. Our work, however, focuses on the changes of individuals\u2019 mental states with\nthe aim to address the following two tasks: (1) to build a classi\ufb01cation system that is\n1 http://www.reddit.com\n\n2 Y . Li et al.\nable to predict changes in the level of user interaction with online MH communities,\nand (2) to discover the underlying factors that correlate with those changes. While we\nwould ideally like to track individuals\u2019 true mental states over time, this information\nis dif\ufb01cult to obtain directly. Therefore, in this work, we focus directly on the change\nin users\u2019 contributions to online MH communities as measured by the number of posts\nthat these users contribute to MH subreddits. We show that this measure is, in fact, sig-\nni\ufb01cantly related to different linguistic expressions of MH symptoms, and should serve\nas a bene\ufb01cial index to consider in the study of MH discussions in online communities.\nWe collect users from MH subreddits and de\ufb01ne a Mental Health Contribution Index\n(MHCI) to separate users into three categories: those who make more, less, or about the\nsame number of contributions to MH subreddits in the second half of a given year\n(between 2017-03-01 and 2017-09-01) compared with those in the \ufb01rst half of that year\n(between 2016-09-01 and 2017-03-01). Here the term contribution means the number\nof posts contributed to target subreddits. When deciding the length of the time period,\nwe follow the approach taken in previous work [21, 20, 18, 19, 35]. For the users in our\nstudy, we seek to address three research questions:\n\u2013 RQ1 . How do users, grouped by their MHCI scores, express different symptoms of\nMH problems throughout the year in general?\n\u2013 RQ2 . Can we build a classi\ufb01er to predict if a user\u2019s contributions to MH subreddits\nwill increase or decrease during the second half of the year?\n\u2013 RQ3 . What factors from the \ufb01rst six months correlate with either an increase or a\ndecrease in MH contributions in the second half of the year?\n2 Data Collection and Annotation\nWe crawl our data through the Python Reddit API PRAW 2 and annotate the data pro-\nduced by a set of redditors (users of the Reddit site). The process consists of the fol-\nlowing steps: (1) Identify MH subreddits and redditors; (2) De\ufb01ne a Mental Health\nContribution Index (MHCI) based on posting and commenting actions; and (3) Filter\ntarget redditors according to their MHCI scores.\nWe start with \ufb01fteen well-studied MH subreddits reported in [21], from which we\ncrawl posts and information about the users who wrote them. The subreddits used in our\nstudy are: r/depression, r/SuicideWatch, r/socialanxiety, r/mentalhealth, r/BPD, r/ptsd,\nr/bipolarreddit, r/rapecounseling, r/StopSelfHarm, r/survivorofabuse, r/EatingDisorders,\nr/hardshipmates, r/panicparty, r/psychoticreddit and r/traumatoolbox. As done in previ-\nous work [22, 43, 21], we do not assume that every user found on these subreddits is\nan active mental health patient. We conducted the crawl on 2017-09-01, collecting data\nfrom the past year, so that time span of our data is from 2016-09-01 to 2017-09-01. We\ncrawl all the authors of posts found on these subreddits in the given time span. After\nremoving moderators and suspended users, we are left with a \ufb01nal set of 53,416 unique\nusers.\nNext, we de\ufb01ne the Mental Health Contribution Index (MHCI) which measures the\nchange in contributions to MH subreddits against Non-MH subreddits for a given red-\nditor between two 6-month time periods. The contribution to MH subreddits is de\ufb01ned\n2 https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n\nText-Based Detection and Understanding of Changes in Mental Health 3\nas the total number of posts contributed in these subreddits, which is regarded as a re-\n\ufb02ection of the attention paid to MH topics, or the extent to which the user may resort\nto help and exchange ideas with others. First, we de\ufb01ne t1 as the time period between\n2016-09-01 and 2017-03-01; t2 as the time period between 2017-03-01 and 2017-09-\n01; mr\ni as the number of posts contributed to MH subreddits inti,i = 1,2 for a redditor\nr; and nr\ni as the number of posts contributed to NonMH subreddits in ti,i = 1,2 for a\nredditor r. We then de\ufb01ne the MHCI score for a redditor ras follows:\nMHCI (r) =\u03b1mr\n2 + 1\nmr\n1 + 1 + \u03b2(mr\n2 + 1)(nr\n1 + 1)\n(mr\n1 + 1)(nr\n2 + 1) (1)\nFig. 1: Distribution of\nMHCI score in 53,416\nredditors.\nFig. 2: Distribution of num-\nber of contributions per day\nover 1,767 redditors.\nFig. 3: Distribution of num-\nber of contributions per day\nover three types of users re-\nspectively.\nThe MHCI score is a weighted sum of the ratio between absolute MH contribu-\ntions and the ratio between relative MH contributions in t1 and t2. We also introduce\na score, MHCI \u2032(r), that is the same as MHCI (r), but it includes the number of to-\ntal posts plus comments (rather than only posts). The distribution of the MHCI score\nfor all 53,416 redditors is shown in Figure 1. The criteria we adopt to \ufb01lter users with\nincreased, decreased and no change in contributions to MH subreddits are as follows:\nincreasegroup : MHCI (r) >2.5,MHCI\n\u2032\n(r) >5\ndecreasegroup : MHCI (r) <0.4,MHCI\n\u2032\n(r) <0.2\nnochangegroup : 0.9<MHCI(r)<1.1,0.75<MHCI\n\u2032\n(r)<1.25\nWe exclude all samples in \u201dgray zones\u201d (e.g. 0.4 < MHCI(r) < 0.9 ) to reduce\nthe risk of misclassi\ufb01cation [16, 52, 19, 47, 33]. For \ufb01ltered users, annotators are asked\nto manually look into all their posts and comments. Only users with self-reported diag-\nnoses of MH problems are kept [13, 12]. Other users who provide help, seek support for\nhelping other people instead of themselves, distribute questionnaires for study and do\nnot reveal their own MH states are ruled out. Based on the criteria above, we derive641\nredditors in the increase group, 758 redditors in the decrease group, and 368 redditors\nin the no change group; these 1,767 redditors form our \ufb01nal dataset which contains\n113,630 posts and 692,203 comments where 13,162 posts and 66,961 comments are\nfrom MH subreddits and the rest are from Non-MH subreddits. Figure 2 and 3 show\nthe activity of our redittors. We identify 703 subreddits that were contributed to by at\nleast 12 of our 1,767 redditors in the \ufb01rst half-year, which we will use to answer RQ3.\nWe anonymized our data and all individuals who participated in our project, including\nannotators, strictly follow the ethical guidelines as suggested in previous work [4, 30].\n\n4 Y . Li et al.\n3 RQ1: Changes of MH Symptoms\n3.1 Method\nIn this section, we measure the differences in language use between the increase group\nand the decrease group over the time span of one year. We calculate the frequencies\nof using words belonging to different semantic categories in the Linguistic Inquiry and\nWord Count (LIWC) [45] lexicon during the year and conduct Welch\u2019s t-test to mea-\nsure if there is a signi\ufb01cant change in the usage of words from these categories. In\nour calculation, a positive t-stat represents the increased use of a semantic category,\nand a negative t-stat represents decreased use. We point out known MH symptoms as\nlinguistic features and analyze the way that those symptoms change over the year.\nTable 1: Welch\u2019s t-test results be-\ntween contents of two six-month pe-\nriods for increase group users (with\nhigh MHCI scores).

Compared with control group, in-\ndividuals with mental issues show more frequent use of categories such as \u2018negative\nemotion\u2019, \u20181st person singular pronouns\u2019, \u2018negate\u2019 and less frequent use of categories\nsuch as \u2018positive emotion\u2019, \u20183rd person singular pronouns\u2019 and \u20181st person plural pro-\nnouns\u2019. Our results in Table 1 and 2 show that, in general, high MHCI users express\nincreased MH symptoms and low MHCI users express decreased MH symptoms in\nsecond half of the year:\n\nText-Based Detection and Understanding of Changes in Mental Health 5\nEmotional Symptoms. High MHCI users show increased use of \u2018negative emo-\ntion\u2019, \u2018sad\u2019 and \u2018anxiety\u2019 categories and decreased use of \u2018leisure\u2019 and \u2018positive emo-\ntion\u2019 categories. However, low MHCI users exhibit the opposite trend.\nLinguistic Symptoms. High MHCI users show an increased use of verbs, which\nis considered to positively correlate with sensitivity [29]. Increased use of \u20181st person\nsingular\u2019 and decreased use of \u20181st person plural\u2019 and \u20183rd person singular pronouns\u2019\nindicates that high MHCI users become more socially isolated and self-attentional in\nthe second half of the year [8]. The opposite trend is also true for the low MHCI users.\nSubjectivity Symptoms. From the \u2018negate\u2019 category, we observe that high MHCI\nusers tend to express more negative opinions in the second half of the year, while low\nMHCI users express fewer negative opinions during the same time period.\n4 RQ2: A Classi\ufb01cation Task\n4.1 Method\nIn this section, we propose an initial framework for a classi\ufb01cation task between high\nand low MHCI users based on only the texts that these users have written. The training\nand test data consists of all posts and comments contributed by the 641 users from the\nincrease group and 758 users from the decrease group during t1 and t2. For each user,\nwe extract features v1 and v2 from raw texts contributed during t1 and t2 respectively.\nThen, v2\u2212v1, which is expected to capture information on changes of language style for\na user between the two halves of the year, serves as an input to a classi\ufb01er. The output\nis binary variable representing whether or not a user\u2019s MH contributions increase or\ndecrease in t2 compared with t1.\nThere are four types of features adopted in our work: Average Word2Vec, Average\nGloVe, Doc2Vec and LIWC. Although Word2Vec and GloVe provide pre-trained word\nembeddings, we train Word2Vec, GloVe and Doc2Vec embeddings from scratch on our\ndata because of the uniqueness of our corpus. Here we introduce our features brie\ufb02y:\nAverage Word2Vec. We use the Continuous Bag-of-Words Model (CBOW) to train\n300-dimensional word embeddings which uses a neural network [36] with negative\nsampling [34]. We set the window size to 5 and the initial learning rate to 0.025. Then,\nfor each user, we average together all word embeddings to produce a single feature\nvector for each of t1 and t2 to produce v1 and v2.\nAverage GloVe. We also train300-dimensional GloVe word embeddings which are\nbased on global word-word co-occurrence statistics [46]. The window size is set as\n15 and the initial learning rate is set as 0.05. For each user, v1 and v2 are derived by\naveraging together all word embeddings in t1 and t2 respectively.\nDoc2Vec. We implement Distributed Memory Model with Paragraph Vectors (PV-\nDM) [34] for training document embeddings with a window size of 10 and an initial\nlearning rate of 0.025. For each user, the model will directly output 300-dimensional\nfeature vectors, v1 and v2, that summarize all the user\u2019s posts and comments in t1 and\nt2, respectively.\nLIWC. We use all semantic categories in the LIWC lexicon [45]. For each user,\nwe count frequencies of use of those categories in t1 and t2 and derive v1 and v2.\n\n6 Y . Li et al.\nWe adopt Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and a custom\nNeural Network (NN) with two hidden layers of size 100 and 20 as our classi\ufb01ers, and\nthey are implemented through SciKit-learn package [44].\n4.2 Results and Analysis\nWe evaluate our models with 10-fold cross validation, and report the average accuracy,\nprecision, recall, f1-score and their 95% con\ufb01dence interval of the score estimate (i.e.\n2 times standard deviation) in Table 3. When using a single-source feature, we \ufb01nd that\naveraged word embeddings can capture the changes of mental states to some extent, but\nthey are inferior to using LIWC categories. Doc2Vec, however, beats LIWC in accuracy,\nrecall and f1-score. When we combine Doc2Vec with LIWC, however, the performance\nincreases even further for all metrics when using the neural network classi\ufb01er.\nFeature and Classi\ufb01er Accuracy Precision Recall F1-Score\nWord2Vec+LR 0.7713 (+/- 0.0662) 0.7542 (+/- 0.0758) 0.7442 (+/- 0.0986) 0.7485 (+/- 0.0760)\nWord2Vec+SVM 0.7820 (+/- 0.0688) 0.7521 (+/- 0.0760) 0.7831 (+/- 0.0911) 0.7668 (+/- 0.0747)\nWord2Vec+NN 0.7649 (+/- 0.0842) 0.7454 (+/- 0.0946) 0.7457 (+/- 0.1500) 0.7395 (+/- 0.1095)\nGloVe+LR 0.7756 (+/- 0.0672) 0.7638 (+/- 0.1046) 0.7442 (+/- 0.0584) 0.7530 (+/- 0.0655)\nGloVe+SVM 0.7692 (+/- 0.0586) 0.7485 (+/- 0.0822) 0.7505 (+/- 0.0658) 0.7489 (+/- 0.0608)\nGloVe+NN 0.7527 (+/- 0.0747) 0.7436 (+/- 0.0907) 0.7209 (+/- 0.1167) 0.7269 (+/- 0.0877)\nLIWC+LR 0.8142 (+/- 0.0412) 0.7941 (+/- 0.0605) 0.8066 (+/- 0.1327) 0.7980 (+/- 0.0574)\nLIWC+SVM 0.8185 (+/- 0.0491) 0.8052 (+/- 0.0584) 0.7989 (+/- 0.1219) 0.8004 (+/- 0.0631)\nLIWC+NN 0.8235 (+/- 0.0419) 0.8170 (+/- 0.0639)0.8238 (+/- 0.1066) 0.8143 (+/- 0.0774)\nDoc2Vec+LR 0.8234 (+/- 0.0668) 0.8107 (+/- 0.0610) 0.8019 (+/- 0.1187) 0.8054 (+/- 0.0803)\nDoc2Vec+SVM 0.8113 (+/- 0.0350) 0.7955 (+/- 0.0399) 0.7925 (+/- 0.0769) 0.7934 (+/- 0.0446)\nDoc2Vec+NN 0.8241 (+/- 0.0377)0.8088 (+/- 0.0563)0.8268 (+/- 0.0691) 0.8181 (+/- 0.0342)\nDoc2Vec+LIWC+LR 0.8392 (+/- 0.0610) 0.8284 (+/- 0.0733) 0.8207 (+/- 0.1025) 0.8235 (+/- 0.0699)\nDoc2Vec+LIWC+SVM 0.8306 (+/- 0.0666) 0.8104 (+/- 0.0689) 0.8238 (+/- 0.1060) 0.8163 (+/- 0.0758)\nDoc2Vec+LIWC+NN0.8614 (+/- 0.0535) 0.8587 (+/- 0.0544) 0.8519 (+/- 0.0763) 0.8558 (+/- 0.0333)\nTable 3: Classi\ufb01cation results with 10-fold cross-validation.

In our case,\nfor each subreddit, we form pairs of users having similar probabilities of contributing\nto the subreddit, but only one user in each pair actually contributed. Then we conduct\nWelch\u2019s t-test to measure if the subreddit may have an effect on those users. Our dataset\nincludes n= 1,767 users and m= 703treatments (subreddits). Confounding variables\nare unigram features for every user, Xi, i = 1 to n. Tj,i, j = 1 to m(binary), repre-\nsents if user ireceived treatment j. A Propensity Score is de\ufb01ned as the probability of\nreceiving treatment jgiven a confounding variable, Pj(Xi) = Prob(Tj,i = 1|Xi), \u2200i,\n\nText-Based Detection and Understanding of Changes in Mental Health 7\nwhich is \ufb01tted with logistic regression model [44]. User labels are denoted as Yi, i= 1\nto n. Then our algorithm is summarized in Algorithm 1:\nAlgorithm 1 Measuring the effects of treatments on MHCI\nRequire: Xi,Yi,Tj,i, i= 1to n, j = 1to m\nfor j = 1to m do\nstep 1: Split data into a training set and a test set.\nstep 2: Fit modelj to the training data.\nstep 3: Form treatment group and control group in test set based on Propensity Score Match-\ning.\nstep 4: Conduct Welch\u2019s t-test on treatment and control groups.\nend for\nreturn t-stats for all mtreatments\n5.2 Results and Analysis\nTable 4: Top 15 treatments that correlate\nwith an increase in MH contributions.\nTreatment t-stat\nr/WikiLeaks 3.464\nr/vancouver 3.464\nr/trypophobia 2.752\nr/Marijuana 2.738\nr/AskPolitics 2.449\nr/cordcutters 2.449\nr/piercing 2.291\nr/cars 2.254\nr/announcements 2.190\nr/MeanJokes 2.038\nr/AskUK 2.070\nr/Bandnames 2.000\nr/solotravel 2.000\nr/whatisthisthing 1.981\nr/Bitcoin 1.951\nTable 5: Top 15 treatments that correlate\nwith a decrease in MH contributions.\nTreatment t-stat\nr/depression 14.191\nr/BipolarReddit 5.740\nr/SuicideWatch 5.554\nr/StopGaming 4.472\nr/bipolar 4.354\nr/pics 4.157\nr/mentalhealth 4.057\nr/pornfree 3.464\nr/rapecounseling 3.314\nr/baseball 3.162\nr/socialanxiety 3.004\nr/comics 2.758\nr/LongDistance 2.738\nr/Rateme 2.662\nr/BPD 2.660\nTable 4 and Table 5 show the top 15 treatments that correlate with an increase in MH\ncontributions and ones that correlate with a decrease in MH contributions, respectively.\nOur analysis will pay more attention to treatments that correlate with decreased MH\ncontributions since their t-stats are relatively higher. We then discuss the results in the\nfollowing aspects:\nSupport Communities. Support communities are shown to correlate with decreased\nMH contributions int2 which are shown to be correlated with reduced MH symptoms in\nRQ1. MH support subreddits include \u2018r/depression\u2019, \u2018r/BipolarReddit\u2019, \u2018r/SuicideWatch\u2019,\n\u2018r/bipolar\u2019, \u2018r/mentalhealth\u2019, \u2018r/socialanxiety\u2019 and \u2018r/BPD\u2019 (Borderline Personality Dis-\norder). Recent work shows the reciprocity between social media users who disclose\ntheir own MH issues and their online audience, which is consistent with our \ufb01ndings\n\n8 Y . Li et al.\n[25, 53]. Other support communities include \u2018r/rapecounseling\u2019 (help with sexualized\nviolence), \u2018r/StopGaming\u2019 (help with video game addiction) and \u2018r/pornfree\u2019 (help with\naddiction to porn).\nInteresting Pictures, Comics and Memes. Some subreddits focus on sharing im-\nages, captioned photos etc. that are intended to be funny. This category includes \u2018r/pics\u2019\nand \u2018r/comics\u2019 and both correlate with decreased MH contributions int2.\nStory Sharing and Friend Making. These subreddits correlate with decreased MH\ncontributions. \u2018r/LongDistance\u2019 is a subreddit to share stories about long-distance rela-\ntionships and \u2018r/Rateme\u2019 for users to rate everyone else. As a support, psychological\nresearch shows that social interaction is helpful to reduce stress [41].\nPolitics. There are two subreddits related to politics in Table 4 and 5. They are\n\u2018r/WikiLeaks\u2019 and \u2018r/AskPolitics\u2019, and both correlate with increased MH contributions\nin t2.\nOther Subreddits . \u2018r/baseball\u2019 correlates with reduced MH contributions in t2.\n\u2018r/Marijuana\u2019, \u2018r/trypophobia\u2019 (a community for those with a common fear of irreg-\nular clusters of holes or bumps found in the world) and \u2018r/piercing\u2019 (for discussion of\nvarious body piercings and jewelry) correlate with increased MH contributions. Some\nsupport for these \ufb01ndings can be found in psychological research on sports [48], drug\nuse [50] and body piercing [54].\nOur \ufb01ndings may provide some insights on what factors may in\ufb02uence individ-\nual\u2019s mental health. Those factors mainly include discussions in certain subreddits like\n\u2018r/Rateme\u2019. Currently, we cannot make any claim on if engagement in a certain subed-\ndit has a causal relationship with mental health, but we still deem it valuable for mental\nhealth researchers to investigate promising correlations such as those that we have dis-\ncovered in this work.\n6 Conclusion\nThis paper provides some insights into detecting and understanding changes in contri-\nbutions to online mental health communities over time. We propose the MHCI index\nand \ufb01lter users whose contributions to MH subreddits increase, decrease and stay about\nthe same over two consecutive six-month periods. Our \ufb01ndings show that increased\nMH contributions correlate with increased MH linguistic symptoms while decreased\nMH contributions generally show the opposite trend. Further, we propose a framework\nfor building classi\ufb01ers to distinguish between high and low MHCI redditors and demon-\nstrate the effectiveness of word embeddings and document embeddings in this task. Our\nwork also reveals the underlying correlation between users\u2019 engagement in discussions\nin different subreddits and changes in those users\u2019 MH contributions over time.\n7 Acknowledgement\nWe thank all anonymous reviewers for their constructive suggestions on our work.
