We propose the MHCI index\nand \ufb01lter users whose contributions to MH subreddits increase, decrease and stay about\nthe same over two consecutive six-month periods. Our \ufb01ndings show that increased\nMH contributions correlate with increased MH linguistic symptoms while decreased\nMH contributions generally show the opposite trend. Further, we propose a framework\nfor building classi\ufb01ers to distinguish between high and low MHCI redditors and demon-\nstrate the effectiveness of word embeddings and document embeddings in this task.\n\nOur\nwork also reveals the underlying correlation between users\u2019 engagement in discussions\nin different subreddits and changes in those users\u2019 MH contributions over time. 7 Acknowledgement\nWe thank all anonymous reviewers for their constructive suggestions on our work.
