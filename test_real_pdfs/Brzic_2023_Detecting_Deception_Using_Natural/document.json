Machine learning models have, through natural\nlanguage processing, proven to be extremely successful at detecting lexical patterns related to\ndeception. In this study, four selected machine learning models are trained and tested on data\ncollected through a crowdsourcing platform on the topics of COVID-19 and climate change. The\nperformance of the models was tested by analyzing n-grams (from unigrams to trigrams) and by\nusing psycho-linguistic analysis. A selection of important features was carried out and further\ndeepened with additional testing of the models on different subsets of the obtained features. This\nstudy concludes that the subjectivity of the collected data greatly affects the detection of hidden\nlinguistic features of deception. The psycho-linguistic analysis alone and in combination with n-grams\nachieves better classi\ufb01cation results than an n-gram analysis while testing the models on own data,\nbut also while examining the possibility of generalization, especially on trigrams where the combined\napproach achieves a notably higher accuracy of up to 16%. The n-gram analysis proved to be a more\nrobust method during the testing of the mutual applicability of the models while psycho-linguistic\nanalysis remained most in\ufb02exible.\nKeywords: deception detection; machine learning; natural language processing\n1. Introduction\nIn today\u2019s world of fast-growing technology and an inexhaustible amount of data,\nthere is a great need to control and verify data validity due to the possibility of fraud.\nTherefore, the need for a reliable form of detection of such content is not surprising. Some\nof the ways in which deception manifests itself on the Internet are using identity deception,\nmimicking data and processes for the purpose of stealing credit card numbers or other\nprivate information, charging false invoices for services not performed, hacking sites,\noffering false excuses and promises, false advertising, spreading propaganda and false\ninformation, and other forms of fraud. Therefore, detecting deception, whether in face-to-\nface interaction or while communicating through a certain medium, is of great importance.\nThe great need to \ufb01nd a reliable method for deception detection is even more em-\nphasized due to the fact that people tell approximately two lies per day [ 1]. Lying is\nundoubtedly a skill that is deeply rooted in the human existence, and it has been perfected\nover the years to a level that is dif\ufb01cult to recognize by even the most experienced pro-\nfessionals. The question is what makes the distinction between truth and lies/deception,\nespecially in the verbal aspect, and if it exists, what is the best way to determine it? Do\nmost of the information lie in non-verbal behavior, or are there certain linguistic patterns\nthat can serve as suf\ufb01ciently precise indicators of deception? Is there a difference in decep-\ntion during face-to-face and computer-mediated communication, whether synchronous or\nasynchronous, verbal or non-verbal?\nAlgorithms 2023, 16, 221. https://doi.org/10.3390/a16050221 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/algorithms\n\nAlgorithms 2023, 16, 221 2 of 34\nResearch so far has led to the conclusion that verbal behavior hides a deep amount of\ninformation that can be used in the detection of deception, almost more accurately than\nin the case of non-verbal analysis. Due to the inapplicability of the polygraph method to\ndeception detection in computer-mediated communication, there is an increasing emphasis\non research in methods for analyzing the syntactic and semantic properties of written text\nand \ufb01nding indicators of deception in various forms of digital interaction. So far, the most\ncommonly used methods of deception detection in the text are machine learning models.\nThere is a great need for further research into syntactic, semantic, and other properties of\nnatural languages in order to create software that will detect deception with high accuracy.\nCurrent research covers deception detection in computer-mediated communication[2,3];\ndetection of fake reviews on social platforms [ 4,5]; deception detection collected from\npublic trials [6,7]; the use of crowdsourcing platforms, such as Amazon Mechanical Turk,\nfor generating deception datasets [ 5,8]; etc. In their work, Feng and colleagues [ 5] also\nanalyzed the deep syntax of the data using the principles of probabilistic context-free\ngrammar (PCFG), independently and in combination with the aforementioned methods. In\naddition to the above, the LIWC tool was also used for deception detection by leveraging\ninsight into the psycho-linguistic characteristics of the analyzed text.\nIn this paper, several different machine learning models were used and their perfor-\nmance in differentiating deceptive and true text was tested. Two sets of data were collected\nusing the crowdsourcing platform Clickworker and the survey tool Qualtrics Survey. For\ndata processing, n-grams, LIWC, and a combination of the two approaches were used. A\nselection of essential features for each model was carried out over the LIWC dimensions\nusing the WEKA tool in order to obtain subsets of features with which the models provide\nthe highest accuracy. Since two distinct datasets on two topics were created, they were\nused to train their own separate models. These models were then tested on their own data,\nbut they were also cross-tested on the data they were not trained with. Furthermore, both\ndatasets were combined to create a joint dataset on deceptive text, which was then used to\ntest both models. The performance of the models was examined in order to gain insight\ninto the possibility of model generalization and its applicability to different datasets. This\ngave insight into model parameters with the highest accuracy in predicting deception. The\npossibility of deception detection using natural language processing methods was also\ntested in order to ascertain which methods give the best performance in a generalization or\napplicability to other datasets than the ones they were trained upon; additionally, it was to\ndecide which method gives the best predictions in general.\n2. Theoretical Background\n2.1. Lie and Deception\nTo deceive means \u201cto lie, mislead or otherwise hide or distort the truth\u201d. Although\nthe term lie is often regarded similar to the term deception, there is a certain distinction\nbetween the two. Lying is just one of many forms of deception, which does not only\nmean uttering an untrue claim, but also manifests itself in \u201comitting the truth or more\ncomplicated covering-up the truth\u201d commonly with the intention to mislead or deceive\nsomeone [8]. The traditional de\ufb01nition states that to deceive means \u201cto cause to believe\nwhat is false\u201d, which naturally leads to the question of whether this includes the case of\nmistakenly or unintentionally deceiving another person, on which many have con\ufb02icting\nviews [9]. However, the majority believes that lying and deception necessarily manifest\nthemselves with intent, so the de\ufb01nition itself has been modi\ufb01ed to de\ufb01ne deception as\n\u201cintentionally causing to have a false belief that is known or believed to be false\u201d [ 9].\nThe de\ufb01nition also implies the success of the act of deception since otherwise, the goal\nof creating a \u201cfalse belief\u201d in another person is not ful\ufb01lled. This is precisely one of the\ndifferences between deception and lying, where lying does not necessarily mean convincing\nanother person was done successfully; it only refers to \u201cmaking a false statement with the\nintention of deceiving\u201d.\n\nAlgorithms 2023, 16, 221 3 of 34\nA slightly broader, generally accepted de\ufb01nition of lying is the following: \u201cA lie is a\nstatement made by one who does not believe it with the intention that someone else shall be\nled to believe it\u201d [10]. According to the stated statement, four main conditions are de\ufb01ned\nthat must be ful\ufb01lled in order for a certain statement to be identi\ufb01ed as a lie: the person\nshould make the statement (statement condition), the person making the statement should\nbelieve that the statement is false (untruthfulness condition), an untrue statement must be\ngiven to another person\u2014the recipient of the statement (addressee condition)\u2014and lastly,\nthe person making the statement must lie with the intention to convince the recipient of the\nstatement to believe the untruthful statement to be true (intention to deceive the addressee\ncondition) [9]. Here, too, there are debates regarding the very de\ufb01nition of \u201clying\u201d, and they\nconcern the intention with which a person lies; these debates lead to two opposing groups,\nnamely the theories of Deceptionism and Non-Deceptionism. The former group believes\nthat intention is necessary for lying while the latter believe the opposite. The theory\nof Deceptionism is further divided into Simple Deceptionism, Complex Deceptionism,\nand Moral Deceptionism. Simple Deceptionists believe that for lying, it is necessary to\nmake an untrue statement with the intention of deceiving another person while Complex\nDeceptionists additionally believe that the intention to deceive must be manifested in the\nform of a breach of trust or belief. Moral Deceptionism state that lying not only requires\nmaking an untrue statement with the intention of deceiving, but also violating the moral\nrights of another person. On the other hand, the theory of Non-Deception dictates that\nlying is a necessary and suf\ufb01cient condition to make an untrue claim, and it is further\ndivided into the theory of Simple Non-Deceptionism and Complex Non-Deceptionism [9].\nUnlike lying, deception itself does not only involve verbal communication, but also\nmanifests itself through various non-verbal signs, such as leading another person to the\nwrong conclusion by certain behavior, using non-linguistic conventional symbols or sym-\nbols that determine similarity (icons), etc. It is also possible to deceive someone with\nan exclamation, a question, a command, an omission of an important statement, and\neven silence [9].\nThis leads to the conclusion that the statement condition does not apply to deception.\nIn the same way, the condition of untruthfulness does not apply because it is possible\nto deceive someone by making a true statement that intentionally implies a falsehood\n(e.g., using true statements to create a false belief). Sarcasm and irony are also weapons of\ndeception that violate the condition of untruthfulness, given that a person states an obvious\ntruth with the intention of leading another person to the opposite (false) conclusion. In\naddition, the stated de\ufb01nition of deception [9] does not de\ufb01ne the subject of deception as a\n\u201cperson\u201d, but refers to anything that is capable of having beliefs, like infants or animals,\nwhich violates the addressee condition, which is constant in the de\ufb01nition of a lie. This\ncondition is also violated, for example, in the case when a person is being eavesdropped\non, which they are aware of, and uses this fact to deceive the eavesdroppers (e.g., deceiving\nsecret service agents) [9]. An interesting case of deception, which is not manifested in lying,\nis when a person, by deliberately avoiding or not accepting the truth, deceives himself\nor herself.\n2.2. Deception in Computer-Mediated Communication (CMC)\nDeception happens every day and in all forms of interaction, through face-to-face\ncommunication or through certain media such as mobile phones, computers, television,\netc. A common assumption is that detecting deception in face-to-face interaction is an\neasier task given that a person has much more information at their disposal, unlike verbal\n\u201conline\u201d communication, which lacks non-verbal signs such as gestures, body posture, facial\nexpressions, etc. In addition, as mentioned in previous research in asynchronous computer-\nmediated communication, the sender has more time, which makes it \u201ceasier for senders\nto construct and/or harder for receivers to detect relative to face to-face interactions\u201d [3].\nNevertheless, in a study conducted on a group of people who participated in face-to-\nface interactions and computer-mediated communication, it was determined that human\n\nAlgorithms 2023, 16, 221 4 of 34\nperformance in detecting deception in computer-mediated communication exceeded that\nin face-to-face interaction and that the truth bias and deception rate in both cases did not\ndifferentiate [11]. However, human prediction accuracy still did not exceed chance.\nZhou and colleagues [2] believe that the sender in CMC distances himself from the\nmessage that \u201creduces their accountability and responsibility for what they say, and an\nindication of negative feelings associated with the act of deceiving\u201d. Likewise, one of\nthe important indicators of why people are better at detecting deception via computers\nis precisely the fact that they lack certain information about the other person, so they are\nmuch more suspicious and will suspect deception sooner.\nResearch in CMC examines the in\ufb02uence of Linguistic Style Matching (LSM) and\nInterpersonal Deception Theory (IDT) on the linguistic characteristics of conversations\nduring honest and fake conversations [ 2,12]. The LSM theory explains how people in\na conversation adapt each other\u2019s linguistic style to match their partner\u2019s. According\nto the LSM theory, deception in a conversation can be detected by analyzing the verbal\ncharacteristics of the interlocutor (who is unaware of the deception) and not exclusively\nthose of the speaker (who is lying) given that their linguistic styles match [ 12]. In the\nstudy conducted during synchronous computer-mediated communication, correlation was\nrecorded in the linguistic style of the interlocutors. More precisely, the correlation was\nachieved when using \ufb01rst, second, and third person pronouns and negative emotions. An\ninteresting conclusion was that the linguistic pro\ufb01les of both interlocutors coincided to a\ngreater extent during false communication compared to true communication, especially\nin a case when the speaker was motivated to lie [12]. There is a possibility that speakers\ndeliberately use LSM when trying to deceive in order to appear more credible to the partner,\nwhich is what the IDT theory deals with. IDT studies the context of the speaker (who is\nlying) and the interlocutor (who is not aware of the deception) and the changes in their\nlinguistic styles through honest or false communication, with the difference that it under-\nstands these changes as strategic behavior that the speaker uses to facilitate the deception\nprocess [13]. \u201cDeceivers will display strategic modi\ufb01cations of behavior in response to a\nreceiver\u2019s suspicions, but may also display non-strategic (inadvertent) behavior, or leakage\ncues, indicating that deception is occurring \u201d [2]. On the other hand, interlocutors in the\ncase of non-strategic behavior may become suspicious and ask more questions, thus forcing\nthe speaker to change his linguistic style and adapt to the interlocutor.\nSo far, the best known method of detecting deception precisely is the use of a poly-\ngraph, which provides insight into a series of autonomous and somatic psycho-physiological\nactivities that are invisible to the human eye, but which strongly signal deception. The\npolygraph relies on the analysis of peripheral activities related to emotions and excitement\nwhile the traditional measures used are most often of a cardiovascular nature (i.e., changes\nin heart rate), electrodermal (changes in the electrical properties of the skin), and respi-\nratory (i.e., rapid and uneven breathing) [ 14]. Although a polygraph is one of the more\naccurate methods, it still provides rather limited insight into complex brain processes that\nmay hide deeper and more precise indicators of deception, so it is not surprising that this\narea of research is on the rise. There are other methods of detecting fraud from behavior\nthrough observing a person using the usual human senses without physical contact; by\ninterpreting subtle signals in behavior by analyzing gestures, linguistics, tone of voice, and\nhandwriting; etc. [14]. Although some of these approaches give quite satisfactory results,\nsuch as the polygraph, their limitation lies in their inapplicability to computer-mediated\ncommunication. It is for this reason that there exists an increasing interest in methods for\nanalyzing the syntactic and semantic properties of written text and \ufb01nding indicators of\ndeception in various forms of digital interaction.\n2.3. Tools and Methods in Deception Detection\n2.3.1. Natural Language Processing\nNatural language processing (NLP) is a multidisciplinary \ufb01eld of linguistics, computer\nscience, and arti\ufb01cial intelligence that focuses on the processing and analysis of large\n\nAlgorithms 2023, 16, 221 5 of 34\namounts of natural language data with the aim of developing software that will understand\nthe content and context of text and speech. By analyzing different aspects of language,\nsuch as syntax, semantics, pragmatics, and morphology, machine learning models learn\nthe rules used to solve given problems. NLP is commonly applied for \ufb01ltering spam and\ngenerally classifying it with search engines for automatic text correction, sentiment analysis\nof different products, classi\ufb01cation of customer feedback, and automation of customer\nsupport as part of virtual assistants, but it is also for many other tasks, including fraud\ndetection. NLP converts input text data into vectors of real numbers that machine learning\nmodels support. Some of the feature extraction methods for natural language analysis are:\n\u2022 The BOW (Bag of Words) approach extracts features from the text and represents\nthem as the occurrence of words used in the text. The BOW analysis consists of the\nvocabulary of the used words and the measure of the occurrence of each individual\nword. It should be noted that the word structure and the order of words are ignored.\n\u2022 N-grams are strings of N symbols or words (tokens) in the analyzed document. Unlike\nBOW, n-grams preserve the order of tokens. Different types of n-grams are suitable for\nsolving different types of problems, so it is necessary to test the models on a wider\nrange of n-grams.\n\u2022 TF-IDF (Term Frequency\u2014Inverse Document Frequency) speci\ufb01es how important a\ncertain word is for the analyzed document, but it is not as naive as BOW. In BOW,\nfrequent words can easily dominate while less frequently used words that carry much\nmore information lose their importance. TF-IDF, in addition to the frequency of word\noccurrence in the current document, also records the inverse frequency; that is, for\neach word, it calculates how rarely it appears in all documents. By combining the\nabove, TF-IDF solves the problem of a dominance of frequent words in relation to less\nfrequent but more important ones.\n\u2022 POS (Part of Speech) are categories of words with similar grammatical properties,\nsuch as nouns, adjectives, verbs, etc. This type of analysis assigns a corresponding\ncategory to each word.\n\u2022 Lemming and stemming are text normalization techniques used in natural language\nprocessing, and their main function is to reduce words to their canonical or root form.\nLemming is a canonical dictionary-based approach and, unlike rooting, takes into\naccount the meaning of words. Stemming is based on rules and is simpler to implement\nand is faster because it does not consider the context when shortening words, which is\nwhy it also does not give as good of a prediction accuracy as lemmatization.\n\u2022 Stop-words are words of a certain language that do not contribute much information to\nthe sentence, and they have a highly frequent occurrence in the text. This is why they\nare often removed from the text when classifying or grouping using machine learning\nmodels. Removing them can greatly increase the prediction accuracy and reduce\nmodel training and testing time, but they should be chosen carefully to preserve the\ntext meaning.\n2.3.2. Machine Learning\nMachine learning (ML) is a \ufb01eld of arti\ufb01cial intelligence that deals with the study\nof methods that independently learn from data and use it for the purpose of improving\nperformance when solving given problems. The models are built on the training data\nand used to make predictions. Today, machine learning is used across all \ufb01elds, such as\nmedicine, computer vision, text classi\ufb01cation/grouping, speech recognition, etc. The base\nsteps of machine learning are data collection, data preprocessing, model selection, model\ntraining and model evaluation, parameter tuning, and prediction. The process of data\ncollection and preprocessing is of great importance given that the models rely on the given\ndata when making decisions. Due to the general lack of labeled data, these are also the\nmost dif\ufb01cult tasks.\nMachine learning models are one of the methods that can be used in deception de-\ntection. Prior to the actual model training, the data is \ufb01ltered, cleaned, and analyzed\n\nAlgorithms 2023, 16, 221 6 of 34\nusing natural language processing methods, and then, it is transformed into a form that\nis acceptable to a certain machine learning model. The models used in this are based on\nlogistic regression, na\u00efve Bayes, SVM (Support Vector Machine), and Random forest:\n\u2022 Logistic regression is a statistical model of machine learning that is used for classi\ufb01ca-\ntion and belongs to supervised machine learning techniques. It outputs a probabilistic\nvalue between 0 and 1.\n\u2022 SVM is a machine learning model that is often used for classi\ufb01cation, but it is also\nused for regression. It belongs to supervised machine learning techniques. Its task is\nto separate N-dimensional data into classes by selecting the best decision boundary\n(discriminant function).\n\u2022 Naive Bayes also belongs to supervised learning techniques. It is based on Bayes theo-\nrem, which naively assumes that the value of a certain variable/feature is independent\nof other variables/features.\n\u2022 The Random Forest model is used for the classi\ufb01cation and regression problem. It is\nbased on the construction of a large number of decision trees, each of which makes\ndecisions on the outcome of the prediction. In the case of classi\ufb01cation, the prediction\nwith the majority of votes is selected while in the case of regression, the average value\nof all predictions is taken as the output of the model.\nK-fold cross validation is used as a method of evaluating the obtained machine learning\nmodels. The parameter k determines the number of groups into which a given data set\nis divided to separate the training from the testing data. Speci\ufb01cally, one set is taken to\ntest the model while the other k-1 datasets are used to train the model. The accuracy of\nthe model is calculated by taking the average value of the model\u2019s prediction through k\niterations. This method provides a less optimistic but less biased assessment of model\nperformance than other methods.\n2.3.3. Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC)\nLIWC (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count) is a software for text analysis designed\nfor the purpose of studying natural language. It consists of two key components: the\nword processing component and the LIWC dictionary. The dictionary forms the core of the\napplication itself, as it connects psychosocial with linguistic constructs and consists of over\n12,000 words, root words, and phrases. Groups of words from the LIWC vocabulary that\nspecify a particular domain are referred to as \u201ccategories\u201d or \u201cdimensions\u201d. Each LIWC\nentry can belong to several LIWC categories and are mostly arranged hierarchically. Origi-\nnally, the categories were cognitive and emotional while with the increasing understanding\nof the psychology of verbal behavior, the number and depth of categories increased [15].\nLIWC receives text records in various formats of input, which it then sequentially analyzes\nand compares with the dictionary. The software counts the words in a given text and\ncalculates the percentage of total words represented in all LIWC subcategories.\nThe latest version of the LIWC-22 offers some improvements over previous versions.\nThe dictionary has been upgraded to handle numbers, punctuation marks, short phrases,\nand regular expressions in order to extend the use of LIWC (for example, to the analysis\nof content from social networks (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat) where such\nlinguistic style is often present). In LIWC-22, the psychometric abilities of the dictionary\nwere improved, and several new categories were added [16].\nThe construction of the LIWC began with the intention of analyzing verbal speech to\nextract psychological processes described through the use of style words and the content\nof what is written or spoken (content words). It was soon concluded that these are quite\ndifferent categories with different psychometric properties. Style words, which are also\ncalled function words, \u201cmake up only 0.05% of the total set of words in the English language,\nand are contained in a total of 55% of all words that we hear, speak or read\u201d. They represent\nthe way people communicate and offer a greater insight into the psychosocial aspect of\nspeech compared to content words, which describe only the content of communication [17].\n\nAlgorithms 2023, 16, 221 7 of 34\nFunction words have proven to be very successful in the analysis of the emotional\nand biological state, status, sincerity, and individual differences; therefore, the emphasis\nis placed precisely on their deeper analysis in order to give insight into psychological\nprocesses that other methods of text analysis simply cannot detect. On the other hand, LIWC\nis a probabilistic system that does not take context into account linguistic constructs such\nas irony, sarcasm, and idioms; therefore, absolute conclusions about human psychology by\nusing only LIWC analysis cannot be drawn [17].\nResearch proves LIWC to be successful in detecting deception. \u201cDeceptive statements\ncompared with truthful ones are moderately descriptive, distanced from self, and more\nnegative\u201d [17]. Such a description is not surprising considering that more information\ncarries a greater risk of uncovering the truth. By analyzing deception in synchronous\ncomputer-mediated communication, it was shown how the linguistic style of the sender\n(who lies) and the receiver (who is unaware of the deception) changes. Both respondents\nwere using more words overall (especially sensory) and fewer 1st person pronouns during\ndeception compared to honest interaction [ 2,3]. Thus, it is obvious that linguistic style\nhides patterns that are speci\ufb01c to true and false communication, which can to some extent\nbe successfully detected using the LIWC approach. Since LIWC software lacks context\nanalysis, it is recommended to combine it with other natural language processing methods.\nBased on previous research, LIWC, together with an analysis combined with n-grams,\nachieved satisfactory results [ 4,5]. Given the large number of dimensions that LIWC\npossesses, a selection of important features needs to be done in order to prevent over\ufb01tting\nand maximize the performance of the machine learning model.\n2.3.4. WEKA\nWeka (Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis) is a software that contains tools\nfor visualization, data analysis, and predictive modeling. Implemented within Waikato\nUniversity, New Zealand, Weka was originally a tool for analyzing data from the agricul-\ntural domain but is used today in various \ufb01elds of research, especially for educational\npurposes. Weka provides support for certain data mining methods, data preprocessing,\nclustering, regression, classi\ufb01cation, data visualization, and feature selection.\n2.4. Related Work on Deception Detection\nA notable work in deception detection during public trials included analyzing verbal\nand non-verbal behavior of suspects and witnesses [6]. Videos of witnesses and suspects\nwere collected during testimonies on public trials and were used to build a reliable machine\nlearning model that can distinguish truth from lies by analyzing verbal and non-verbal\ncharacteristics and thus provide assistance in making key decisions in the judiciary. The\nmodels based on n-grams were tested individually on different sets of verbal and non-\nverbal features and in combination. A further analysis of a subset of features revealed\nthat the model gives better results when it is trained on non-verbal features, mostly by\nanalyzing facial expressions, which are then followed by unigrams. Human performance\nin deception detection was tested by analyzing text, sound, noiseless video, and video with\nsound, which achieved worse results compared to the used machine learning models.\nIn another study, three different approaches were used when analyzing data on false\nand true positive hotel reviews [4]. Truthful reviews were collected from the TripAdvisor\nplatform while fake reviews were generated using the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform,\ncontaining opinions created with the intention of deceiving another person. The text was\nanalyzed using POS and n-gram techniques and psycho-linguistic analysis using LIWC\nsoftware. The models were tested individually and in combination, and only those with\nthe best performance were selected. Data processing led to the conclusion that bigrams\ngenerally give the best results while the combination of bigrams and psycho-linguistic\nanalysis gives a slightly better result. In addition, all tested methods outperform humans\non the same dataset. In the same paper, by comparing the features obtained using POS\nanalysis, LIWC, and a combination of analysis with n-grams and LIWC, it was noted that\n\nAlgorithms 2023, 16, 221 8 of 34\npeople hardly fake spatial information. Through the analysis of POS, the authors came\nto the conclusion that some of the language structures that are most often used in honest\n(informative) reviews are nouns, adjectives, prepositions, conjunctions, and verbs while\nfake (imaginary) reviews mostly use verbs, adverbs, and pronouns. Verbs and adverbs\nare common features in both types of reviews, but with an important difference: in the\ninformative text, the past participle is mostly used while in the imaginary text, a much\nwider range of different verb tenses is used.\nSomewhat better results on the same TripAdvisor hotel reviews dataset were achieved\nwith a deep syntax analysis (that is, by using features derived from the analysis of parsed\ntrees obtained from probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG)) [ 5]. The mentioned ap-\nproach is combined with shallow syntax (i.e., POS tags) but still gives the best results in\ncombination with n-grams, proving that the analysis of deep syntax offers information not\npresent in the learned POS features and that it can serve as a more reliable method when\ndetecting deception. The models were tested on 4 different datasets, from the domain of\nfake reviews from the TripAdvisor and Yelp platforms and sets of essays collected through\nAmazon Mechanical Turk on the topics \u201cabortion\u201d, \u201cbest friend\u201d, and \u201cdeath penalty\u201d.\nThe same set of essays was analyzed using LIWC software in the work of Mihalcea\n& Strapparava [8], showing slightly less favorable results. In fake essays, references to\nother people (\u201cyou\u201d, \u201cothers\u201d, \u201cpeople\u201d) and words related to certainty are mostly present\nwhile in true essays the person con\ufb01dently connects with the statements made using more\nreferences on oneself (\u201cI\u201d, \u201cfriends\u201d, \u201cself\u201d) and presents several attitudes based on belief\n(\u201cthink\u201d, \u201cfeel\u201d, believe\u201d) [8]. In addition to TripAdvisor, the analysis of fake reviews was\nalso conducted on social platforms, such as Twitter [18].\nThe answer to the question of which machine learning model best differentiates the\ntrue from false data is not easy to come by given that each model works speci\ufb01cally\nconcerning the speci\ufb01c problem and dataset on which it is trained and tested, which is also\noften conceptualized by the speci\ufb01c context by the researchers in the area [19]. Zhou and\ncolleagues in their research [2] deal with the deception detection in asynchronous computer-\nmediated communication by examining four machine learning models on data collected\nthrough two experimental studies. The research is based on the detection of deception from\nthe point of view of interaction, not individual analysis. A similar study was conducted in\norder to understand changes in the linguistic behavior of people participating in a deceptive\nor truthful discussion during synchronous computer-mediated communication [3]. The\nresearch was conducted by dividing respondents into groups of two people who were\ngiven the task of talking to each other via e-mail and, thus, getting to know each other.\nAll respondents were given several topics to discuss in such a way that one respondent\n(sender) was randomly selected from each group and assigned a task to deceive the person\n(recipient) by giving a false opinion on two of the \ufb01ve given topics. Likewise, the importance\nof motivation in deception was examined in such a way that the senders were randomly\nassigned the additional task of being highly or lowly motivated while lying. The data were\nanalyzed using the LIWC software in order to extract statistically signi\ufb01cant features related\nto false or true communication and to test the hypotheses based on LSM and IDT. Based on\nLSM and IDT, changes in the behavior of the interlocutor (recipient) were also analyzed in\norder to examine whether deception can be detected from changes in his behavior. It was\nalso investigated the extent to which motivation changes the linguistic style of a person\nwho lies/deceives in synchronous computer-mediated communication. The results show\nthat senders statistically use more words during deception, more references to other people\nand less to themselves, and more emotional words. Motivated senders avoid causal terms\nlike \u201cbecause\u201d, \u201chence\u201d, and \u201ceffect\u201d while unmotivated ones use more simple negations.\nAccording to LSM and IDT theories, recipients use more words and ask more questions\nduring deception, especially when the sender is not motivated [3].\nPrevious research focused on detecting deception using and combining a few machine\nlearning algorithms and models, mostly Na\u00efve Bayes and SVM and to a certain extent\nanalysis on a small range of n-grams. This paper extends the state of the art by employing\n\nAlgorithms 2023, 16, 221 9 of 34\na wider set of machine learning algorithms and models and uses wider combinations of\nn-grams. Speci\ufb01cally, prior research was exclusively done on bigrams while this study uses\nn-grams ranging from unigrams to trigrams. Such an extended set of models, algorithms,\nand n-grams was further combined with a speci\ufb01c analysis using LIWC, examining its\noperation on different datasets. The study contributes to the discussion on models\u2019 ap-\nplicability in terms of generalization, where n-grams were found to be the most robust\nmethod for deception detection and the analysis using LIWC the least \ufb02exible. The best\nopportunity for generalization were noted with the use of combinations of n-grams and\nanalysis using LIWC.\nThe literature review presented in this chapter is summarized in a table form as part\nof Appendix A.\n3. Methodology\n3.1. Problem Statement: Creating a Reliable Deception Detector\nGiven that human capabilities for detecting lies are very limited, machine learning\nmodels that have proven to be the best tool for predicting deception in computer-mediated\ncommunication were used. However, the \ufb01rst problem that arose in model use was the lack\nof labeled input data with truthful and deceptive statements. In a majority of prior work,\ndata were collected using crowdsourcing platforms [4,5,8] while other research was done\non \u201creal\u201d data collected through social experiments [2,3] by analyzing public trials [6,7] or\nby some other method.\nAnother problem was the choice of text processing methods and machine learning\nmodels that gave the best prediction. By analyzing the choice of machine learning models in\nprevious research, it could be concluded that Naive Bayes and SVM classi\ufb01ers have proven\nto be very successful in solving this type of a problem [4,5,8], so they represent the choice\nof methods in this study as well. Logistic regression [2] and Random forest [6] were used\nsomewhat less often, but they achieved acceptable results, so they were also included in the\nset of models for this study as additional methods. Due to the performance of computational\nlinguistics methods used in previous research, in this study, data were analyzed using\nn-grams as opposed to POS analysis because it gave more precise results [ 4,5]. Another\nreason for choosing n-gram analysis lay in the fact that it worked very well in combination\nwith other methods. In a previous study, the highest precision was achieved by combining\nn-grams and deep syntax analysis when analyzing four different datasets [5] while or by\ncombining LIWC analysis and bigrams [ 4]. LIWC has also served as a relatively good\ndeception detector in other studies [3] because it provided insight into the psychological\u2013\nlexical characteristics of words, which was not given with n-gram analysis. To increase\nmodel reliability, important LIWC features needed to be selected since the use of redundant\nfeatures could greatly reduce the predictive power of machine learning models.\nBased on the aforementioned research, in this paper, it was decided to use a combina-\ntion of analysis with n-grams and LIWC with individual approaches as veri\ufb01cation. Deep\nsyntax analysis was not examined in this paper because of the complexity of extracting\nimportant features from the data parsed using PCFG and the complex choice of production\nrules. The complete process of the methods applied in this study is given in Figure 1.\n\nAlgorithms 2023, 16, 221 10 of 34\nAlgorithms 2023, 16, x FOR PEER REVIEW 10 of 31 \n \nproduction rules.

Applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Creating Models\nData collection was followed by cleaning and pre-processing so that the models that\nwould be subsequently applied analyze and predict more precisely. The \ufb01rst step consisted\n\nAlgorithms 2023, 16, 221 12 of 34\nof removing special characters and numbers from the text, followed by decontraction (i.e.,\nreduction of shortened and connected words to their long form). Word segmentation\n(tokenization) and lemmatization were performed to reduce the words to their normalized\nform. Stemming was not used because compared to lemmatization, it gives less favorable\nresults, which was expected considering that it does not rely on a dictionary. The method\nof removing stop words was not used because they were an important factor in the pre-\ndiction of deception. By comparing the performance of the models tested using TF-IDF\nvectorization and the classic BOW approach, the TF-IDF technique was chosen due to more\naccurate prediction.\nFour different models were chosen: logistic regression, SVM, Naive Bayes, and Ran-\ndom Forest. The models were trained and tested individually and on combined data to\ngain insight into the possibility of mutual applicability of the models and the possibility\nof generalization by comparing the natural language processing approaches. The models\nwere tested on a wider range and combination of n-grams and a varying number of features\nto identify the models with the highest prediction accuracy. The performance of models\nbased on n-grams, LIWC analysis, and a combination of the two mentioned approaches\nwere compared. All models were tested using 10-fold cross-validation. In the process, the\nmost important features were selected from the LIWC analysis using the WEKA tool.\nFeature Selection and LIWC\nThe models tested on all LIWC features did not give results comparable with those\nobtained by n-gram analysis, warranting them for feature selection. Important LIWC\nfeatures for both datasets (DS1 and DS2) and the combined dataset (DS3) were selected\nwith the use of the WEKA tool. Two different feature selection approaches were used:\nAttribute Correlation Evaluation and Attribute Subset Evaluation. The following three\nclasses were selected:\nThe CorrelationAttributeEval class evaluated features by measuring the Pearson\ncorrelation coef\ufb01cient between the features and the class. The Ranker search method was\nused to rank the attributes according to their evaluations.\nThe CfsSubsetEval class belonged to attribute subset evaluators and was based on the\nevaluation of feature subset values with regard to the degree of redundancy among features\nand the predictive ability of each individual feature. This approach prefered subsets of\nfeatures that had a high correlation with the class and low correlation with each other. The\nsearch method used with CfsSubsetEval was BestFirst.\nThe WrapperSubsetEval class also belonged to the attribute subset evaluators and\nused a learning scheme to evaluate feature sets and their accuracy by cross-validation. The\nsearch method used in conjunction with WrapperSubsetEval was also BestFirst.\nThe models tested on the selected features did not achieve the expected precision,\nso it was decided to narrow down the set of selected features. The models were tested\non different subsets of the selected set of features (only subsets of size 4 to 11 features\nwere considered due to the time complexity of checking all existing combinations of sets\nlarger than 11 features). After testing the models, it was concluded that the attribute\nsubset evaluators selected the features with which the models provided the most accurate\npredictions, especially the WrapperSubsetEval class. The lists of the best subsets of selected\nLIWC features for each model, for both DS1 and DS2 datasets and the combined dataset\nDS3, can be found in Appendix B.\nTable 2 shows LIWC subcategories (features), the category to which it belongs, abbre-\nviations, descriptions, the most frequently used examples belonging to that subcategory\nand internal consistency calculated using the alpha coef\ufb01cient (Cronbach\u2019s alpha), and the\nKuder\u2013Richards (KR-20) formula.\n\nAlgorithms 2023, 16, 221 13 of 34\nTable 2.

Model Testing on DS2 (COVID-19 Dataset)\nTable 4 shows the results obtained by testing the selected machine learning models\non the DS2 data set by analyzing LIWC, n-grams, and combining those two approaches.\nThe logistic regression model achieved the highest accuracy of 74.62% in the analysis using\nLIWC while the multinomial Naive Bayes gave slightly worse results with 74.58%. SVM\nusing the same approach achieved an accuracy of 73.32% while the random forest model\ntested using LIWC analysis gave the worst accuracy of 69.98%. Examining the model\nthrough combinations of n-grams, Naive Bayes tested on a combination of unigrams and\nbigrams leads with an accuracy of 73.86%. It is followed by SVM tested on bigrams with\n72.05% and logistic regression tested on a set of bigrams and trigrams with the accuracy\nof 71.67%. All models tested with the LIWC analysis achieved higher accuracy than the\nmaximum model performance obtained by the n-gram analysis. Using the combined analy-\nsis of n-grams and LIWC, the maximum accuracy of 76.39% on the analysis of unigrams\nand bigrams was achieved with the multinomial Bayes, followed by the SVM tested on\nbigrams with an accuracy of 76.34%. The logistic regression and random forest also gave\nsatisfactory results of 75.05% on unigrams and 72.97% on bigrams.\n\nAlgorithms 2023, 16, 221 16 of 34\nThe maximum recall of 78.18% was achieved by combining an analysis of (1,2)-grams\nand LIWC using multinomial Naive Bayes while the SVM model achieved the maximum\nprecision of 77.35% with the combined analysis of bigrams and LIWC.\n4.3. Model Testing on the Combined Dataset (Climate Change and COVID-19 Datasets Combined)\nThe combined dataset DS3 was also analyzed with LIWC, n-grams, and their combina-\ntion and was tested using the four machine learning models (Table 5). By testing the model\non the features obtained with the LIWC analysis, the SVM model achieved the highest\naccuracy of 74.60%. It is followed by the logistic regression and random forest with 74.40%\nwhile multinomial Naive Bayes achieved an accuracy of 72.20%. When comparing the\nperformance of the models achieved with the LIWC to the n-gram analysis, virtually all\nmodels classify better using the LIWC approach except for the multinomial Naive Bayes\nmodel, which achieved an accuracy of 74.00% by analyzing unigrams and bigrams, which\nis an increase of 1.8% compared to the LIWC analysis. The logistic regression and SVM\nachieved their maximum accuracy of 72.80% and 71.80% by testing on bigrams while the\nleast favourable results were obtained with classi\ufb01cation using the random forest model\n(69.60%). By combining analysis with n-grams and LIWC, the models achieved the best\nperformance. SVM tested on bigrams with the maximum accuracy of 77.00%, followed\nby logistic regression with 76.20% and random forest with 75.40%. In this analysis, the\nmultinomial Naive Bayes model (75.20%) achieved slightly worse results by analyzing\ndata using the combined techniques (n-grams and LIWC). By comparing the results by\ntesting the model on different sets of n-grams, it was found that the models mostly perform\nbetter using an analysis combining n-grams and LIWC as opposed to an analysis using\nLIWC only.\nTable 5.

Due to the inapplicability of the polygraph method to \ndeception detection in computer-mediated communication, there is an increasing empha- \nsis on research in methods for analyzing the syntactic and semantic properties of written \ntext and finding indicators of deception in various forms of digital interaction. So far, the \nmost commonly used methods of deception detection in the text are  machine learning \nmodels. There is a great need for further research into syntactic, semantic, and other prop- \nerties of natural languages in order to create software that will detect deception with high \naccuracy. \nCurrent research covers deception detectio n in computer-mediated communication \n[2,3]; detection of fake reviews on social platforms [4,5]; deception detection collected \nfrom public trials [6,7]; the use of crowdsourcing platforms, such as Amazon Mechanical \nTurk, for generating deception datasets [ 5,8]; etc. In their work, Feng and colleagues [5] \nalso analyzed the deep syntax of the data using the principles of probabilistic context-free \ngrammar (PCFG), independently and in combination with the aforementioned methods. \nIn addition to the above, the LIWC tool was also used for deception detection by leverag- \ning insight into the psycho-linguistic characteristics of the analyzed text. \nIn this paper, several di\ufb00erent machine learning models were used and their perfor- \nmance in di\ufb00erentiating deceptive and true text was tested. Two sets of data were collected \nusing the crowdsourcing platform Clickworker and the survey tool Qualtrics Survey. For \ndata processing, n-grams, LIWC, and a combination of the two approaches were used. A \nselection of essential features for each model was carried out over the LIWC dimensions \nusing the WEKA tool in order to obtain subsets of features with which the models provide \nthe highest accuracy. Since two distinct datasets on two topics were created, they were \nused to train their own separate models. These models were then tested on their own data, \nbut they were also cross-tested on the data they were not trained with. Furthermore, both \ndatasets were combined to create a joint dataset on deceptive text, which was then used \nto test both models. The performance of the models was examined in order to gain insight \ninto the possibility of model generalization and its applicability to di\ufb00erent datasets. This \ngave insight into model parameters with the highest accuracy in predicting deception. The \npossibility of deception detection using natural language processing methods was also \ntested in order to ascertain which methods give the best performance in a generalization \nor applicability to other datasets than the ones they were trained upon; additionally, it \nwas to decide which method gives the best predictions in general. \n \nFigure 8.

Consequently,\nthe overall average accuracy obtained by this approach is also higher than the average\nresults obtained by the n-gram analysis for each of the three datasets, DS1, DS2, and DS3.\nConsidering the average accuracies obtained for all sets of n-grams, the analysis with\nn-grams and LIWC achieves the maximum on DS2 using the analysis of unigrams and\nbigrams (74.12%) and with the analysis of bigrams on DS3 (75.60%). Dataset DS1 was best\nclassi\ufb01ed using unigrams and bigrams (78.51%).\nBy comparing the average accuracies obtained using all machine learning models on\nall selected sets of n-grams and LIWC, the analysis using a combination of (1,2)-grams and\nLIWC gives the most accurate results (75.71%).

While testing these models on the DS2 data using the same method, the maximum\naverage accuracy of the models was achieved by analyzing LIWC and trigrams (75, 21%).\nConsidering the overall average obtained by the testing models trained on DS3 and tested\non DS1 and DS2 datasets, the best average accuracy was achieved using bigram and LIWC\n(76.40%). The second best results were achieved by analyzing unigrams and LIWC (75.98%)\nand (1,3)-grams and LIWC (75.73%). Analyses exclusively with LIWC or n-grams achieved\nworse average results on all models compared to the combined analysis.\nModels trained on DS3 and tested on DS1 data achieved better results than those\nmodels tested on DS2 dataset for each of the data processing methods used.\n5. Discussion\n5.1. Datasets and Models\nThe best classi\ufb01cations of datasets DS1, DS2, and DS3, considering the average accu-\nracies obtained using all the models presented in Table 12, were achieved with the LIWC\nanalysis and by combining n-grams and LIWC. The above two methods also generalize\nbest according to testing the combined dataset DS3 individually on the DS1 and DS2\ndata (Table 13).\nThe climate change dataset (DS1) proved to be more applicable to deception detection\ncompared to the COVID-19 dataset (DS2) and the combined dataset (DS3). Machine learn-\ning models achieved the best average results on DS1 using all data processing approaches\n(Table 14). While examining the possibility of generalization by training models on the com-\nbined dataset (DS3) and testing on individual datasets (DS1 and DS2), models also achieved\nbetter performance tested on DS1 compared to the DS2 dataset. Consequently, models both\ntrained and tested on the combined set achieved better average results compared to the\ntraining and testing on dataset DS2. It appears that DS2 data offers less information that\ncan be used in deception detection compared to other datasets. Given that DS2 (dataset\n\nAlgorithms 2023, 16, 221 29 of 34\nfor COVID-19) is based on answers related to partly more current and potentially more\npersonal experiences, there is a possibility that participants lied more successfully on a topic\nthat is closer to them and more subjective; therefore, the very distinction of lies using the\nselected data analysis methods became more dif\ufb01cult. In addition, there is a possibility that\nfor the same reason participants were more motivated to lie more convincingly considering\nthe scope of experience they have about COVID-19 and consequently achieved a higher\nsuccess rate of deception. On the other hand, data collected on the topic of climate change\nare potentially more objective, which leads to weaker results when trying to deceive.\nDuring training and testing of the machine learning models on the DS2 dataset, it was\nnoted that the analysis with LIWC (73.13%) or the combined approach (73.33%) achieves\nbetter average results than those obtained exclusively with n-grams (67.34%) (Table 12).\nThe analysis using the combined approach on the same dataset also achieves better average\nresults on all sets of n-grams compared to the analysis exclusively with n-grams (Table 14).\nOn the other hand, during the training and testing models on data DS1, there was no such\nsigni\ufb01cant difference in the average accuracy of predictions using LIWC (77.45%) and the\ncombined approach analysis (77.04%) compared to the n-gram analysis (75.27%), but the\naverage results achieved using these methods are still more favorable than those obtained\nwith the n-gram analysis (Table 12). Given the above, it follows that n-grams better detect\npatterns related to deception by analyzing the DS1 compared to the DS2 dataset.\nA statistical consideration of the number of above-average predictions that exceed those\ndefined by trends by models (Tables 12 and 13) and trends by methods (Tables 14 and 15)\nshows that logistic regression proved to be the most reliable model with the most above-\naverage values compared to other methods (Table 9). It also showed good performance\nin combination with the LIWC analysis, where it achieved the highest number of above-\naverage predictions compared to other models tested with the LIWC analysis on the same\ndatasets. The random forest model achieved the least favorable above-average results\nwhile training and testing on the same datasets (Table 9). Examining the possibility of a\ngeneralization of the models by training them on DS3 and testing on DS1 and DS2 datasets,\nthe highest number of above-average predictions (in relation to the trend by models and\ntrend by methods) was achieved using the SVM and multinomial Naive Bayes models\nwhile the random forest showed the lowest rate of above-average predictions. At this point,\nit is dif\ufb01cult to conclude as to which model is generally most applicable to the problem of\ndeception detection given that all models have shown different performances on different\ndatasets using different data analysis methods.\nIt is important to note that the procedure for selecting important LIWC features is\nlimited to testing the models on all combinations of subsets up to the size of 11 features\nobtained using the WEKA tool (due to the factorial time complexity). The feature selection\nadopted in this study potentially needs to be improved by testing the model performance\non feature subsets larger than 11 features or by applying another feature selection method.\n5.2. Generalization\nThe models trained on the DS3 dataset, when tested on DS1, achieved a less favorable\naverage accuracy with the n-gram analysis (71.54%) compared to the models trained and\ntested on DS1 (75.27%). Conversely, by testing the models based on DS3 on the dataset DS1\nwith the analysis using a combined approach, better average results (78.01%) were obtained\ncompared to training and testing the models on the DS1 data using the same processing\ntechnique (77.04%) (Tables 12 and 13). The same trend applies to the LIWC analysis, which\nalso achieved better results. For model DS2, the analysis with LIWC or a combination of\nn-grams and LIWC generalizes better compared to an analysis exclusively with n-grams\nsince it achieves better performance during training models on several different datasets\nfrom different domains.\nOn the other hand, by testing the models obtained based on the DS3 dataset on the data\nDS2, an average drop in performance was recorded using all models and all data analyzing\nmethods compared to both training and testing the models on the dataset DS2, but by\n\nAlgorithms 2023, 16, 221 30 of 34\ncombining the analysis with n-grams and LIWC, all models achieved higher maximums\naccuracies. The LIWC analysis on all models gives an average accuracy of 71.08%, which is\n2.05% less than in the case of training the model on DS2 data. The analysis with n-grams\nrecorded an average drop in the accuracy of predictions of 1.92%, and the smallest average\ndrop was achieved with the analysis with a combined approach (0.43%) (Tables 12 and 13),\nwhich, on the other hand, for certain n-grams, achieved higher maxima in relation to the\nmodels trained on the DS2 dataset (Table 7). Although the average accuracy when training\nall models on the combined DS3 dataset slightly drops, it again follows that combining the\nanalysis with n-grams and LIWC has somewhat greater generalization power compared\nto exclusively using the n-gram analysis. In addition, the analysis with the combined\napproach, unlike the analysis with n-grams, achieved better average results on almost all\nsets of n-grams during the testing of the models based on the DS3 dataset on the DS1 and\nDS2 data (Table 15). The biggest difference in the performance of the models obtained with\nthe n-gram analysis and the combined approach of analysis is visible during the testing\nof models based on the DS3 on the DS2 data by analyzing trigrams where the combined\napproach achieves a 16.24% higher accuracy.\n5.3. Model Applicability\nExamining the possibility of mutual applicability by testing the models obtained based\non the datasets DS1 and DS2 on the datasets DS2 and DS1, it was concluded that the n-gram\nanalysis gives the best average predictions compared to other data analyzing methods.\nWhen testing models based on the DS2 on the DS1 data, the n-gram analysis even achieves\nan increase in the average accuracy of all models compared to training and testing the\nmodels on the DS1 data (7.77%). The LIWC analysis, on the other hand, shows the least\napplicability to other datasets. As a result of the stated claims, the analysis by combining\nn-grams and LIWC achieves less favorable applicability than the analysis with n-grams,\nbut it is still better than the analysis with LIWC. It can be concluded that n-grams are the\nmost robust analysis method that allows the greatest \ufb02exibility when applying models\ntrained on one dataset to another.\n6. Conclusions\nDeception detection has turned out to be quite a demanding problem considering\nthe various inherent limitations. The \ufb01rst problem encountered is \ufb01nding validly labeled\ntrue and false data. Given that there is no absolutely reliable method of verifying the\nveracity of the same information, such a problem was approached in this study with\ncaution, taking into account the amount of motivation and sincerity the people demonstrate\nwhen answering the de\ufb01ned survey questions during the data collection procedure.\nMachine learning models proved to be successful when working on these collected\ndatasets, which once again con\ufb01rmed the existence of hidden linguistic features of decep-\ntion present in verbal communication. Natural language processing methods achieved\nsatisfactory results while LIWC analysis and the combined analysis of n-grams and LIWC\nproved to be the most successful in deception detection. By examining the possibility of\ngeneralization, the mentioned methods also achieved better performance compared to\nthe analysis with n-grams, especially on trigrams, where the analysis using a combined\napproach achieved signi\ufb01cantly better prediction compared to the analysis exclusively with\nn-grams. Such detected generalization is in line with the recent research efforts leading\nto conclusions that \u201cdeceptive text is more formulaic and less varied than truthful text\u201d,\nhowever more research in this area is warranted [20]. However, during the testing of the\nmutual applicability of the models, the n-gram analysis proved to be a more robust method.\nWhile testing the performance of the models obtained based on the DS1 dataset on the\nDS2 data, the n-gram analysis achieved better results compared to training and testing the\nmodels on own data (DS1). On the other hand, the LIWC analysis proved to be the most\nin\ufb02exible when it came to its applicability to other datasets.\n\nAlgorithms 2023, 16, 221 31 of 34\nMachine learning models with LIWC can be used independently in the detection of\ndeception with certain limitations, such as the fact that they are much less applicable to the\ndatasets on which they have not been trained. The combined approach with n-grams and\nLIWC in most cases allows for even more successful differentiation between truth and lies.\nTherefore, machine learning models and the approach to deception detection should be\ncarefully selected depending on the speci\ufb01cs of the given problem, such as the need for\napplicability to other datasets or the possibility of generalization.\nIn addition to the scienti\ufb01c value of this study, the approach has practical advantages.\nUnlike state-of-the-art deep learning models, which can be computationally intensive\nand time-consuming, our approach requires less computational resources and is faster.\nThis makes it more accessible and feasible for researchers and practitioners who may\nnot have access to high-performance computing resources or who need to process large\namounts of data quickly. Moreover, the ef\ufb01ciency of our approach does not compromise its\neffectiveness in detecting deception. By combining psycho-linguistic analysis and n-grams,\nour study achieves high classi\ufb01cation accuracy, especially on trigrams, which is comparable\nto state-of-the-art models. Therefore, our approach not only provides a more practical\nsolution, but also delivers comparable results to more resource-intensive methods.\nFurthermore, our study highlights the importance of considering the subjectivity of\nthe data when analyzing it for deception, which is a crucial factor in the effectiveness of any\nmachine learning model. By exploring the use of a psycho-linguistic analysis, our study\nalso demonstrates the potential bene\ufb01ts of incorporating linguistic features beyond just\nn-grams, which could inspire further research in this area.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, I.B. and B.B.; Methodology, I.B. and B.B; Software, B.B.;\nValidation, I.B., B.B. and M.B.B.; Formal Analysis, B.B.; Investigation, I.B. and B.B.; Resources, I.B.;\nData Curation, B.B.; Writing\u2014Original Draft Preparation, B.B.; Writing\u2014Review & Editing, B.B., I.B.\nand M.B.B.; Visualization, B.B.; Supervision, I.B.; Project Administration, I.B.; Funding Acquisition,\nI.B.
