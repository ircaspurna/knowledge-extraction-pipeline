      "text": "Theoretical background\nThe following sections present some background on the main topics explored in this review. Deception detection. Deception detection is the act of deciding whether a certain com-\nmunication carries the truth or not. It is an active and evidence-driven inference process [14]. High-stakes deceptions are believed to induce behavioral and physiological changes in the\ndeceiver, yielding more evident indicators of lie-telling [1]. The task even more challenging\nbecause no clue alone is an indisputable predictor of deception [2, 4, 15]. The behavioral and physiological changes experienced by the deceiver work as deception\ncues [1, 2, 16].\n\nAn observer that notices these cues may be enabled to detect an attempt of decep-\ntion. Such behavioral changes are what human lie detectors observe to make their judgment. Deception cues can be verbal (effects on the deceiver\u2019s speech) and non-verbal (impact on\nhow the deceiver speaks and acts). The different sources of cues are usually called modalities\nor channels. For instance, the cues identified from a deceiver\u2019s voice are said to be from the\nvocal channel or to belong to the vocal modality.",

The need for better ways to detect deceptions stimulated the creation of aiding technology\nto increase the detection accuracy. The most famous example is the polygraph, introduced in\nthe Berkeley Police Department by John Larson [17], in 1921.\n\nThe current polygraph models\ncan monitor several physiological responses from a subject and require a preliminary calibra-\ntion step to establish a baseline for the operator. It is essential to understand that the polygraph does not detect lies. Instead, it shows physio-\nlogical alterations related to emotions [2]. It\u2019s the operator that interprets and decides whether\na given message is sincere or not. There are accounts of false positives who have been exoner-\nated of criminal charges after further investigations proved the polygraph test mistakenly\ndetected a deception [2].",

Machine Learning can be applied to many different tasks, such as Classification, Regression,\nClustering, Association Rules, and Anomaly Detection. For each task, different techniques can\nachieve different performance levels.\n\nClassification tasks rely on algorithms that assign a given class (or label) to a specific data\nexample. Those classes are a limited number of categorical values [19]. So, they are not contin-\nuous values (while features can be). Models for Classification problems (classifiers) frequently use a so-called supervised learn-\ning process. Each training data example already has a label (or class) assigned [21].

Most studies trained their classifiers with\nmock data, but the adoption of real-life data is increasing; features include verbal and non-\nverbal cues, mainly facial expressions, gestures, body temperature, prosodic and vocal fea-\ntures, and linguistic patterns; 117 different kinds of features were exploited as deception\ncues, distributed in nine modalities. c) What performance level have they recently achieved?\n\nPerformance was measured\nmostly by accuracy, ranging from 0.51 to 1.0; other performance metrics were\nF1-score, Area Under the Curve (AUC), Unweighted Average Recall (UAR), Recall, and\nPrecision. Besides, deception detection was treated as a binary classification problem, except for one\ncase. Many studies were dedicated to a single modality, but multimodal studies seem to\nbecome a trend.",

High-\naccuracy catchers exploit different cues than those with lower performance, suggesting that\nspecific cues carry important information about deception. Although profession does not seem to be related to lie-catching skills, even high-perfor-\nmance catchers show a particular ability with certain kinds of deception, having a performance\ndecrease when faced with other kinds [5, 15].\n\nThe conclusion is that certain kinds of lies pro-\nduce different cues than others, and the experience on detecting a given kind of deception\ndoes not guarantee skills to detect others. Moreover, situational and idiosyncratic factors can affect the subjects\u2019 behavior and, there-\nfore, which cues are leaked when deceiving. Such cues are more specific and challenging to\ndetect [4]. Not considering these factors can decrease the detection accuracy\u2014a situation\nreferred to as the Brokaw hazard [2]. This finding works as a reasonable explanation for the variety of experiment results.",

The Othello error occurs when lie-\ncatchers confuse emotions and motivations. The emotion is present, but it does not originate\nfrom deception. This is a strong stimulus for further research and efforts to produce labeled datasets from\nactual data under more diverse circumstances. More cues could be identified and related to par-\nticular settings. Fake expressions from actors could be an important addition to the datasets.\n\nSuperior lie-catchers seem to acquire their ability from a personal desire to perform better\non their job, no matter what it is [5]. It is like any other professional skill or talent, improved\nthrough effort, dedication, personal interest, technical knowledge, and training. Thus, such\nhighly skilled lie-catchers result from intense dedication, which is a motivating factor for fur-\nther research on deception detection. It is reasonable to believe that those levels of accuracy\ncan be approximated or even replicated by a Machine Learning classifier given the correct cues\nare processed and interpreted.",
