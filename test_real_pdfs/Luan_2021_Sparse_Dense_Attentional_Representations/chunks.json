Typically, a lexical graph is built, where each\nword or phrase is a node and edges represent the similarity between two\nnodes. Then, propagation methods are used to determine the sentiment of\neach node, given the sentiment of an initial set of nodes.\n\nMost of these lexicons are built for large, general domains like Twitter. However, the sentiment of a word depends on the speci\ufb01c domain in which\nit is used. Recent work builds domain-speci\ufb01c sentiment lexicons using label\npropagation methods and domain-speci\ufb01c corpora (Hamilton et al. (2016)). Lexicons are also used for many tasks outside of sentiment analysis. For\ninstance, LIWC, a general lexicon, is used to quantitatively analyze content in\ntasks ranging from personality prediction (Schwartz et al.
