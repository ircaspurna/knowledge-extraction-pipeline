In recent years, deceptive behaviors\nhave been transformed and have emerged into new paradigms,\nsuch as money laundering, etc. Fortunately, it is indeed the case\nthat some enterprise-wide fraud can be systematically detected\nwith the assistance of emerging information technologies. Conventionally, data analysis approaches using power laws\nhave been adopted as a feasible artifact to offer valuable\nassistance to fraud detection incomputer auditing operations.\n\nBenford's Law is actually one of the most commonly\nutilized power laws for fraud detection. The underlying\nconcept Benford's Law states that in the lists of numbers\nobtained from real-life data resources, the distribution of\nleading digit is a long-tail distribution[4]. To this end, many\nprior researchers have proved that auditors could improve\ntheir performance by conducting analytical procedures before\nutilizing substantive tests [10,12,25,32]. For example, the\nstudy of Reed and Pence[25] examines the appropriateness of\nDigital Analysis as an analytical review procedure to deter-\nmine the possibility of \ufb01nancial statement fraud.",

      "text": "However, there are some limitations while using\nBenford's Law for fraud detections[30]. The restrictions noted\nby the author include the following:\n1) Some populations of accounting-related data do not con-\nform to a Benford distribution[10] [18,19]. For instance, we\nfound that in some businesses, numbers (especially\nmonetary amounts) in transactions are not a natural set. For example, when evaluating a data\ufb01le of travel claims\nyou might\ufb01nd that the\ufb01rst-two-digit combination of 24\nappears more often than expected with Benford's Law.\n\nThis\nmight happen if the company has a policy that stipulates\nthat reimbursement claims for $25 and above must be\nsupported with receipts \u2014 so travelers claim a lesser\namount, such as $24.95. Therefore, it is hard to use\nBenford's Law when the amounts are mostly identical.\n2) Using Digital Analysis may generate too many cases to\nreview [30]. As an example, in a database containing\n250,000 records, one expects that approximately 12,250\nrecords will start with 10. Should one\ufb01nd 15,000 numbers\nstarting with 10, there is a doubt, and we still have to check\n15,000 transactions.",

However, Statements on Auditing Standards, SAS 410,\nsuggests that analytical procedures should be designed\nto consider each kind of different data shape simulta-\nneously and identify the interrelation of\ufb01nancial and non-\n\ufb01nancial data.\n\nAlthough Digital Analysis using Benford's Law had been\nproven to facilitate auditor review on overwhelming volumes\nof data and transactions, there are many drawbacks from\nusing this particular method.
