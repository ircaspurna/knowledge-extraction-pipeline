According to the\nresults of KPMG's Fraud Survey of 2003, organizations are\nreporting more experiences of fraud than in prior years[16].\nIn 2003, 75% of surveyed companies reported that they\nexperienced an instance of fraud, an increase of 13% as\ncompared with 1998. Furthermore, Ernst & Young's Global\nSurvey pointed out that the main contributing factors to the\nprevalence of fraud are the growing complexity of organiza-\ntions and systems, change si nb u s i n e s sp r o c e s s e sa n d\nactivities, enormous and ever-expanding volumes of transac-\ntion data, outdated and ineffective internal controls and so on\n[11]. Complex organizations and transactions lead to\nincreased opportunity for subjective interpretation, border-\nline disclosure and even misrepresentation.\nAuditors must take fraud prevention and awareness\nseriously. The main reason is that the occupational fraud issue\nagainst organizations is a costly business problem. The\neconomic impact can be signi\ufb01cant: up to 6% of organizations'\nrevenues may be lost annually as a result of fraud and abuse[3].\n1\nWithin the United States, this translates into losses of\napproximately $660 billion. Furthermore, the true cost of\nfraud goes beyond the\ufb01nancial loss to the impact on reputation,\ndiversion of management focus, and loss of morale and trust\nwithin teams[11]. However, recent corporate scandals clearly\nindicate the potential for fraud abuse and many auditors lack\nthe skills and expertise to deal with the related risks.\nIt is clear that there is a critical need to implement some\ntechnology solutions to auditing areas, especially the data\nanalysis technique [17]. Proper data analysis is critical as a\nmeans of allowing auditors to streamline audit processes,\nbring fraudulent activities to light before they result in critical\nlosses, minimize\ufb01nancial losses, and ensure compliance with\nbusiness rules and external regulatory requirements, such as\nSAS 410 and SOX.\nIn this research, the authors propose an innovative\nmechanism of analytical review procedure, named \u201cZipf\nAnalysis\u201d that utilizes the conception of Zipf's Law to facilitate\nthe systematic construction of a fraud detection model. For the\npurpose of building such fraud detection systems, we examine\nthe properties of Zipf's Law and evaluate its capability of\ndiscriminating abnormal records from a simulation experiment\nDecision Support Systems 46 (2008) 70\u201383\n1 ACFE, Report to the nation,http://www.acfe.com/fraud/report.asp.\n\u204e Corresponding author.

Section 3 describes the systematic mechanism\nof the fraud detection model on the basis of Zipf's Law.\nSections 4 and 5, present a simulation experiment for the\nsystem implementation and evaluation of the proposed\nmechanism by comparing other fraud detection methods.\nFinally, the conclusions of this study are provided in Section 6.\n2. The problem and related work\nFraud by nature is composed of the following three categories:\nintentional illegal act, the concealment of that act, and deriving a\nbene\ufb01tf r o mt h a ta c t[5,8]. In recent years, deceptive behaviors\nhave been transformed and have emerged into new paradigms,\nsuch as money laundering, etc. Fortunately, it is indeed the case\nthat some enterprise-wide fraud can be systematically detected\nwith the assistance of emerging information technologies.\nConventionally, data analysis approaches using power laws\nhave been adopted as a feasible artifact to offer valuable\nassistance to fraud detection incomputer auditing operations.\nBenford's Law is actually one of the most commonly\nutilized power laws for fraud detection. The underlying\nconcept Benford's Law states that in the lists of numbers\nobtained from real-life data resources, the distribution of\nleading digit is a long-tail distribution[4]. To this end, many\nprior researchers have proved that auditors could improve\ntheir performance by conducting analytical procedures before\nutilizing substantive tests [10,12,25,32]. For example, the\nstudy of Reed and Pence[25] examines the appropriateness of\nDigital Analysis as an analytical review procedure to deter-\nmine the possibility of \ufb01nancial statement fraud. They\nindicate that using Digital Analysis in analytical procedures\ncan be more effective or ef\ufb01cient than tests of details in\nreducing detection risk for speci \ufb01c \ufb01nancial statement\nassertions. In addition, the Statement of Auditing Standards\nNo. 410 also suggested that auditors should apply analytical\nprocedures at the planning stage to assist in understanding\nthe business and in identifying areas of potential risk. On the\nother hand, some studies in the accounting area have also\nsuggested that Digital Analysis could be used as an analytical\nreview procedure to assist auditors in identifying any possible\nfraud issues. However, there are some limitations while using\nBenford's Law for fraud detections[30]. The restrictions noted\nby the author include the following:\n1) Some populations of accounting-related data do not con-\nform to a Benford distribution[10] [18,19]. For instance, we\nfound that in some businesses, numbers (especially\nmonetary amounts) in transactions are not a natural set.\nFor example, when evaluating a data\ufb01le of travel claims\nyou might\ufb01nd that the\ufb01rst-two-digit combination of 24\nappears more often than expected with Benford's Law. This\nmight happen if the company has a policy that stipulates\nthat reimbursement claims for $25 and above must be\nsupported with receipts \u2014 so travelers claim a lesser\namount, such as $24.95. Therefore, it is hard to use\nBenford's Law when the amounts are mostly identical.\n2) Using Digital Analysis may generate too many cases to\nreview [30]. As an example, in a database containing\n250,000 records, one expects that approximately 12,250\nrecords will start with 10. Should one\ufb01nd 15,000 numbers\nstarting with 10, there is a doubt, and we still have to check\n15,000 transactions. Therefore, we understand that some\no\nther \ufb01lters are necessary to narrow down these sets of\ndata to a manageable size and to reduce some noisy data.\n3) When execute analytical procedures with Benford's Law,\nauditors only can use the data of digital shape for analysis.\nHowever, Statements on Auditing Standards, SAS 410,\nsuggests that analytical procedures should be designed\nto consider each kind of different data shape simulta-\nneously and identify the interrelation of\ufb01nancial and non-\n\ufb01nancial data.\nAlthough Digital Analysis using Benford's Law had been\nproven to facilitate auditor review on overwhelming volumes\nof data and transactions, there are many drawbacks from\nusing this particular method. After completing related\nliterature review we found another power law by the name\nof Zipf's Law. The basic concept of Zipf's Law is that the\nfrequency of the word occurrence in an article in fact\nfurnishes a useful measurement and hence, management of\nword signi\ufb01cance: The product of frequency of the use of\nwords, f, and the rank order, r, is approximately constant[39].\nMany scholars believe that Benford's Law is a special case of\nZipf's Law[21]. According to Zipf's Law, we believe we can use\nZipf's Law to verify the frequency of string or date\ufb01elds in\nrecords. Therefore, this research aims to construct an\nanalytical procedure mechanism on the basis of Zipf's Law\nand further test its performance of detecting anomalies by\ncomparing with other fraud detection algorithm. The follow-\ning Table 1 summarized the comparison between Digital\nAnalysis using Benford's Law and Zipf's Law, accordingly.\nThe concept of Zipf's Law has also been adopted in the area\nof Information Retrieval. Information Retrieval (IR) typically\ninvolves problems inherent to the collection process for a\ncorpus of documents, and then provides functionalities for\nusers to\ufb01nd a particular subset of it by constructing queries\n[13]. Basically, the idea of IR implementation revolves around\nan attempt to systematically extract information from avail-\nable document corpora, and then utilize it to determine\nwhether or not each document is relevant to a particular\nrequest [28]. Among the various IR models, the Vector Space\nModel (VSM) is one of the most popular and successful\napproaches for modeling in the IR associated environment\nTable 1\nComparison between Benford's Law and Zipf's Law\nBenford's Law Zipf's Law\nThey are both derived from Nature Laws.\nThey can be used to handle disaggregated account level data.\nThey both follow the principle of Power Law.\nShows relationship between digit\nand frequency.\nShows relationship between rank and\nfrequency.\nNumeric attributes are required No pre-requirements de\ufb01ned for type of\nattributes.\nApplied for fraud detection\nalready\nUnder review as a potential tool for fraud\ndetection\n71S.-M.
