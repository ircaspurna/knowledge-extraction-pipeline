In the aftermath of the terror attack, officials expressed\nconcerns about the level of security, pointing to systematic security\nflaws and insufficient staff training at Brussels Airport (Bilefsky, 2016). This incident suggests that an additional screening of passengersbefore\nthey arrive at the airport could be vital for the detection of aviation secu-\nrity threats.\n\nAlthough many existing methods aim at safeguarding avia-\ntion security, concerns have been voiced about the validity of these\nmethods (Meijer, Verschuere, & Merckelbach, 2017; Ormerod & Dando,\n2015). More research regarding the screening of airport passengers is\nneeded to improve aviation safety. One possible line of inquiry is to\nexplore whether one can differentiate between true and false intentions\n(Jupe, Leal, Vrij, & Nahari, 2017; Vrij, Granhag, Mann, & Leal, 2011).",

      "text": "Among the more promising approachesto detect deception is examining\nthe verbal content to discern truthful from deceptive statements (Bond &\nDePaulo, 2006; Oberlader et al., 2016). Verbal deception detection is\nrooted in the assumption that the verbal account of an event is informa-\ntive about the veracity of that account. For example, genuine experiences\nare often reported differently than fabricated experiences, one of the\ncore assumptions of reality monitoring (RM, Johnson & Raye, 1981).\n\nRM states that the differences are attributable to the process by which\nthe memory of an event is constructed: Memories of truthfully experi-\nenced events have been obtained through perceptual processes, whereas\nfabricated memories were built through cognitive operations. Deception\nresearchers adopted this idea and found promising results for verbal\ndeception detection (Johnson, Bush, & Mitchell, 1998).",

To date, research into the verbal approach to the detection of\ndeceptive intentions has examined different verbal cues with some-\ntimes contradicting findings. In one study, passengers at international\nairports were instructed to lie or tell the truth about their forthcom-\ning trip (Vrij et al., 2011). Those who lied about their journey\nprovided statements that were less plausible and included more con-\ntradictions than truthful statements but did not differ in the amount\nof detail.\n\nBuilding on the notion that the expectedness of the ques-\ntions asked might moderate the effectiveness of the verbal deception\ndetection approach (Vrij & Granhag, 2012), another series of experi-\nments asked participants expected and unexpected questions about\na fabricated or truthful future event (Fenn, McGuire, Langben, &\nBland\u00f3n\u2010Gitlin, 2015; Warmelink et al., 2013; Warmelink, Vrij, Mann,\nJundi, & Granhag, 2012).",

Named entity recognition (NER) is an information\nextraction method that identifies and classifies information from natu-\nral language into predefined categories (e.g., persons, dates, and times). Truthful statements are expected to contain more named entities than\ndeceptive statements because truthful accounts (a) are typically richer\nin detail (Johnson et al., 1998; Masip et al., 2005), (b) contain more\nverifiable details (Nahari et al., 2014), and (c) are often more contextu-\nally embedded (K\u00f6hnken, 2004).\n\nThe named entity\u2010based approach\nhas been shown to be useful for the identification of deceptive and\ntruthful hotel reviews (Kleinberg, Mozes, et al., 2017). These findings\nsuggest that named entities might be a means to measure the liars'\nstrategy of withholding potentially incriminating information (e.g.,\npersons that could be consulted to verify an alibi), resulting in liars'\nmentioning fewer named entities.",

In two experiments, par-\nticipants wrote either a deceptive or truthful statement about their\nplanned activities on the forthcoming weekend. In the first experiment,\nall participants read a detailed model statement and were asked to lie\nor tell the truth about their weekend plans. The theory of verbal\ndeception detection predicts that truthfully intended activities can be\nrecalled in more detail and contain more planning markers and fewer\njustifications for the intended actions than deceptive intentions. Because the primary aim of this study was to test the detectability of\ndeceptive intentions in a potentially large\u2010scale setting, we collected\ndata through an online interface and focused on computer\u2010automated\nanalysis.",
